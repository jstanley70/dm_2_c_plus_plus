<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>   HTML Viewer Errata   </TITLE></HEAD><BODY><BR><IMG SRC="images/sasslogo.gif"><H2><A NAME="About HTML Viewer" ISIX>About HTML Viewer...</A></H2><P>HTML Viewer is a simple hypertext viewer, or "browser", meantto be used by people who do not have access to a full-featured browserlike Mosaic or Netscape.  It is also handy for authoring HTML documents,as it does not have the overhead that the more capable browsers have.</P><P>The basic code for HTML Viewer was written as a weekend project, and thenenhanced over a few weeks.  The reason that the viewer could be writtenso quickly is due in large part to the existence of Marco Piovanelli'sWASTE text engine, for which I am grateful.  This library made it possibleto overcome the limitations of the Mac's built-in Text Edit Manager, andalso made inline graphics possible.</P><P>HTML Viewer implements those portions of HTML that are most widely used.Anything HTML Viewer cannot do is probably something that the average HTMLauthor will not want to do anyway.  More details on the<A HREF="#Limitations">limitations of HTML Viewer</A> are given below.</P><P>HTML Viewer also implements some simple extensions to HTML (whichshould be ignored by other browsers) that make it more suitable fordistributing on-line documentation.  More details on the<A HREF="#Extensions">extensions of HTML Viewer</A> are given below.</P><H2><A NAME="Using HTML Viewer" ISIX>Using HTML Viewer</A></H2><P>"You are about to use one of the most powerful, yet easy to use softwareprograms ever written."  I've actually seen this statement on anothersoftware package (which will remain nameless).  Well, HTML Viewer is notthat powerful, but it is pretty easy to use.  Just drag and drop any textdocument onto the HTML Viewer icon.  If the text document contains anyHTML markups, they will be interpreted (within the stated<A HREF="#Limitations">limitations</A>).  If the document is plain text,that's how it will appear.  You can also use the Open command from thefile menu to open any text document.</P><P>If you launch HTML Viewer without a document, a "Home Page" will bedisplayed (the term "Home Page" comes from the World Wide Web, whichuses HTML documents heavily).  The Home Page text is read from one ofa few possible places, scanned in this order:</P><OL><LI> the data fork of HTML Viewer (unless Power Mac code is present)<LI> the file named <SAMP>default.html</SAMP> in the same     folder as HTML Viewer<LI> the file named <SAMP>index.html</SAMP> in the same     folder as HTML Viewer<LI> the file named <SAMP>readme.html</SAMP> in the same     folder as HTML Viewer<LI> the file named <SAMP>viewer.html</SAMP> in the same     folder as HTML Viewer</OL><P>If neither of these locations contains any text, then no window initialis displayed.  An HTML document can then be opened using drag and dropor the Open command.  The file named <SAMP>viewer.html</SAMP> must bethis file.  If you redistribute HTML Viewer, you can change the Home Pageby placing your own file in the same folder as HTML Viewer, using one ofthe first three file names.  In this case, choosing "About HTML Viewer"from the Apple menu will open this document.</P><H3> Navigation Aids </H3><P>HTML Viewer maintains two lists of documents.  Documents in these listscan be opened at any time by choosing from the appropriate menu.</P><H5> The History List </H5><P>This list contains the twenty most recent documents that have been opened.It is maintained by HTML Viewer (i.e., you cannot change the contentsexcept by opening a new document).  This list is persistent over multiplelaunches of HTML Viewer.</P><P>To remove a bookmark from the History list, hold down the<SAMP>command</SAMP> key while selecting the item from the Historymenu.  Yes, you <B>can</B> change the past <SAMP>;-)</SAMP></P><H5> The Bookmarks List </H5><P>This is HTML Viewer's user-configurable document list.  Bookmarks canbe added to this list in one of two ways.  First, you can select sometext in a document and then choose the "Add Bookmark" command.  You willbe prompted for a bookmark label, which will appear in the Bookmarks menu.You can also add any hypertext link to the Bookmarks list by holding downthe command key and clicking the link.  Note that in this case the linkwill <STRONG>not</STRONG> be followed.</P><P>To remove a bookmark from the Bookmarks list, hold down the<SAMP>command</SAMP> key while selecting the item from the Bookmarksmenu.</P><H5> The Index Menu </H5><P>Some documents will provide an Index to their contents.  In such cases,the Index menu appears, and when an item is chosen from it, HTML Viewerwill scroll to the proper location in the document.  This feature isprovided by a simple <A HREF="#Extensions">extension</A> to HTML, andwill not be available in other browsers.</P><H3> Graphics Formats in HTML Viewer </H3><P>In order to make distribution easier, HTML Viewer supports the PortableNetwork Graphics (PNG) specification, which is a replacement format forthe patented Graphics Interchange Format (GIF).  Since PNG is not yetsupported by many Mac Web browsers, HTML Viewer provides a way to makeyour HTML documents "back off" to PNG images.</P><P>Any time you use <SAMP>&lt;IMG SRC=<I>image</I>.gif&gt;</SAMP>, HTMLViewer will first look for a GIF image named <SAMP><I>image</I>.gif</SAMP>.If this file cannot be found, then HTML Viewer will look for a PNG imagenamed <SAMP><I>image</I>.png</SAMP> and use it if it is present.  This way,an HTML document can refer to and use GIF images on the Web, and the samedocument can use PNG images with HTML Viewer.  Of course, you can also use<SAMP>&lt;IMG SRC=<I>image</I>.png&gt;</SAMP>, in which case only the PNGimage will be used and other HTML browsers will not display the graphicunless they support PNG.</P><P>Start using PNG now!  Help make it as ubiquitous as GIF is, and soonall graphics-aware programs will support it.  PNG has some featuresthat make it more flexible than GIF, and PNG is designed to becompletely royalty free. I know of one Macintosh graphics utilityprogram -- GraphicConverter by Thorsten Lemke -- that can work withPNG images.  GraphicConverter 2.1.4 is the first version that supportsPNG.  You can download this shareware program ($30) from most of theMacintosh FTP archives.</P><H3> Forms, CGI applications, and AppleScript & Frontier </H3><P>HTML Forms allow users to do more than just passively browsethrough a set of documents.  Forms accept input from the user, and canact on this information in virtually any way.  While information inputis handled by the HTML browser, the actions taken on this informationare handled by a separate program.  For HTML forms that are served upby an HTTP server, it is the server that runs a Common GatewayInterface (CGI) program that determines what actions to take.</P><P>In the case of WebSTAR and MacHTTP (the two most popular Macintoshbased HTTP servers), form input is passed to an external applicationby means of an <SAMP>'sdoc'</SAMP> AppleEvent.  Although these Mac CGIprograms can be written in any language, the easiest way to write CGIsis to use a scripting language like AppleScript or Frontier.  I won'tgo into the details of writing CGIs, since there are many tutorialsand primers available on the Web (search for "WebStar" and "CGI" usingyour favorite search engine).</P><P>HTML Viewer implements both sides of the Forms process:  On the browserside, the form is displayed and can accept input, while on the "server"side, HTML Viewer knows how to load and communicate with any CGI programthat accepts the <SAMP>'sdoc'</SAMP> AppleEvent.  This makes HTML Viewera great way to test your Forms and CGIs without having to set up anHTTP server.</P><P>If you use AppleScript to write CGIs, HTML Viewer can speed up yourdevelopment cycle by eliminating the "compile" step.  Usually, when youare developing an AppleScript CGI, you cycle through the following steps:</P><OL><LI> Write code<LI> Compile script as a runnable "applet"<LI> Load form and test CGI script<LI> Quit from compiled script applet<LI> Fix bugs and cycle</OL><P>HTML Viewer knows how to load, compile, and execute AppleScriptscripts that are in source format (uncompiled), and thus eliminatessteps (2) and (4) above.  Of course, you can still use the compiledapplet with HTML Viewer and you can also use compiled scripts.  Notethat this is all possible because Apple's Open Scripting Architectureis so damn cool.</P><P>Frontier has a faster development cycle than AppleScript, but HTMLViewer can still speed up CGI development since you don't need tocopy your scripts to your HTTP server for testing.  HTML Viewer alsosupports UserLand's menu sharing protocol.</P><P>Most of the standard Forms-related markups are recognized by HTML Viewer.The following  <SAMP>&lt;INPUT...&gt;</SAMP> types are supported:<SAMP>TEXT</SAMP>, <SAMP>RADIO</SAMP>, <SAMP>CHECKBOX</SAMP>,<SAMP>SUBMIT</SAMP>, <SAMP>RESET</SAMP>, <SAMP>IMAGE</SAMP>,<SAMP>PASSWORD</SAMP> (password is not obscured), <SAMP>HIDDEN</SAMP>,<SAMP>SCRIBBLE</SAMP>, and <SAMP>RANGE</SAMP> (in the last two cases,input is via a text box, and no verification is performed).  The<SAMP>FILE</SAMP> input type is not supported.  The <SAMP>TEXTAREA</SAMP>and <SAMP>SELECT</SAMP> (and <SAMP>OPTION</SAMP>) markups are alsosupported within forms, and of course the <SAMP>FORM</SAMP> markup issupported.  You can use either the <SAMP>POST</SAMP> or the<SAMP>GET</SAMP> method for submitting a form.</P><P>Currently, some of the parameters of the <SAMP>'sdoc'</SAMP> AppleEventare filled in with default values.  The full request (<SAMP>Kfrq</SAMP>)parameter will always be empty.  Input data (direct object and<SAMP>post</SAMP> parameters) is encoded using the standard URL scheme,including space substitution (ASCII 32 is replaced with '+').</P><H3> Other Features </H3><P>HTML Viewer has a few "hidden" features that might prove useful to somepeople.  </P><UL><LI> Force the current document to be re-read by typing			<SAMP>command-R</SAMP><LI> Open a document in a new window by holding down the			<SAMP>option</SAMP> key	<UL>	<LI> when clicking a hypertext link	<LI> when opening a new document via the Open command	<LI> when choosing a document from the History menu	<LI> when choosing a reference from the Bookmark menu	</UL><LI> Click and hold on a hypertext link to see its destination<LI> Single and double quotes are "smart" (except in preformatted text)<LI> "Smart printing" eliminates widows, orphans, etc.<LI> Supports GetURL AppleEvent, as well as standard suite<LI> Uses Internet Config to launch network programs</UL><P>Besides these, HTML Viewer also supports Macintosh Drag and Drop fromits windows.  This is really a feature of WASTE.  I've extended thisfunctionality so that PNG, GIF, and JPEG images can be dragged to otherprograms that support Drag and Drop, and will be translated to standardMac PICTs.  This means you can also make "clipping" files of any imageif you are running a proper version of Finder.</P><P>Color images are dithered using System 7's dithering algorithm, whichproduces pretty good images most of the time.  The good news is thatthe images retain their colors when moved between monitors on a multiplemonitor setup, and when placed on the clipboard.  The bad news is thatthey take slightly longer to draw than when HTML Viewer used its owndithering algorithm.  Check out the image below on a black and whitemonitor to see what happens to a ramp of 16 grays:<BR><IMG SRC="images/grays.gif"></P><P>Images deeper than 8 bits will always be dithered to 8 bits so that youcan Copy and Paste them and they will still work on Macs that do not have32-bit QuickDraw.  I'll probably take this limitation out at some point.For now, this only effects JPEG image quality.</P><P>The System 7 dithering algorithm is much better than HTML Viewer's oldscheme, which dithered images while they were being loaded and not everytime they were drawn.</P><H2><A NAME="Limitations" ISIX>Limitations</A></H2><P>HTML (<U>H</U>yper<U>T</U>ext <U>M</U>arkup <U>L</U>anguage) is a powerfulpublishing tool that can be used to create technical and non-technicaldocuments in a variety of fields.  However, like any complex language, onlya small subset of the language, a "working vocabulary", will be used by mostpeople.  This is especially true for those who use HTML to create WorldWide Web pages.</P><P>HTML Viewer attempts to understand the most common working vocabulary ofHTML, and no more.  The three most important features of HTML that arenot understood by HTML Viewer are the <SAMP>FIG</SAMP>, <SAMP>MATH</SAMP>,and <SAMP>TABLE</SAMP> related markups.  Also missing are many of theattributes that can be added to certain markups.  HTML Viewer does notcurrently support paragraphs (<SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>) within list itemsdue to limitations of the text engine.</P><!--	<P>	HTML Viewer does not currently support forms, either, as there is no way	to send forms to the proper destination (HTML Viewer will never handle	network connections to Web servers, or FTP, Gopher, etc).  However, since	it is nice to be able to see what a form will look like when designing it,	HTML Viewer will support forms in a later version.	</P> --><P>Most HTML attributes are not supported.  The main exceptions to this rule are the<SAMP>HREF</SAMP>, <SAMP>NAME</SAMP>, <SAMP>SRC</SAMP>, and <SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP>attributes, which are necessary in order to locate and navigate files (well,the <SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP> attribute is just for looks). The <SAMP>HREF</SAMP>and <SAMP>NAME</SAMP> attribute are only recognized in the<SAMP>&lt;A...&gt;</SAMP> markup (as is the <SAMP>ISIX</SAMP><A HREF="#Extensions">extension</A> attribute).  The <SAMP>SRC</SAMP> and<SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP> attributes are only recognized in the<SAMP>&lt;IMG...&gt;</SAMP> markup.</P><P>Furthermore, HTML Viewer will currently only handle one attribute per markup.This means that you cannot do something like this:</P><PRE>	...&lt;A HREF=foo NAME=bar&gt; Foobar &lt;/A&gt;...</PRE><P>You can easily get around this limitation by using the following construct:</P><PRE>	...&lt;A HREF=foo&gt; &lt;A NAME=bar&gt; Foobar &lt;/A&gt; &lt;/A&gt;...</PRE><P>HTML Viewer is forgiving of missing <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> and/or<SAMP>&lt;/P&gt;</SAMP> markups, although the rules for whitespace will not beoverridden.  This is about the extent of HTML Viewer's flexibility.  If youare creating an HTML document, you should make every effort to write "good"HTML.  Using HTML Viewer to check the layout of your work will be a goodtest whether or not you have succeeded.  I still don't know if this isa feature or a flaw, but it is staying the way it is.  Think of HTMLViewer as the <SAMP>lint</SAMP> of HTML <SAMP>;-)</SAMP></P><!--	<P>	Finally, color PNG and GIF images are dithered using a simple	context-insensitive scheme that produces passable images most of	the time.  I will probably enhance the dithering scheme if I can	find some paper that describes how it can be done, but otherwise I	have never really been that interested in mucking with graphics. 	Check out the image below on a black and white monitor to see what	happens to a ramp of 16 grays (HTML Viewer actually has 64 levels	of shading, but you get the point):	<BR>	<IMG SRC="images/grays.gif">	</P>	<P>	Now, compare this to what a real dithering algorithm	(Floyd-Steinberg) would do to the same source image:	<BR>	<IMG SRC="images/fs-grays.gif">	</P> --><P>If you come across any other glaring omissions or strange behaviour inHTML Viewer, please <A HREF="#Contacting the Authors">let me know</A>.</P><H2><A NAME="Extensions" ISIX>Extensions</A></H2><P>Extensions are typically only interesting to HTML authors, as they arenot available except through the use of HTML.  There are many good reasonswhy HTML browsers should not define any extensions and instead rely on thestandard HTML as currently defined.  There are even more reasons why HTMLauthors should not use any browser-specific extensions, but the main oneis that the person who reads the document might not be using that particularbrowser.</P><P>None-the-less, I have decided to include a few simple extensions in HTMLViewer so that it would be more useful for distributing on-linedocumentation. These extensions will be ignored by other browsers.</P><H5> The INDEX Markup </H5><P>The more useful extension is the <SAMP>ISIX</SAMP> attribute.  When thisattribute appears in a name markup (<SAMP>&lt;A NAME</SAMP>), HTML Viewerwill place an item in the Index menu.  For example:</P><PRE>	...&lt;A NAME = "Licensing" ISIX&gt; Licensing Restrictions &lt;/A&gt;...</PRE><P>This markup places an item named "Licensing" in the Index menu. Whenthe user chooses that item, HTML Viewer will scroll to and select theenclosed text (in this case, "Licensing Restrictions").  Note that thevalue of the <SAMP>NAME</SAMP> attribute is used for the menu item.</P><P>There might be a better (or official) way to do this in HTML.  If youknow this for sure, <A HREF="#Contacting the Authors">let me know</A>and I'll do it right.  This is the second method that I've used for theindex extension. The first method is still supported, but had some sideeffects that this new method does not have.</P><H5> PICT Images </H5><P>The second extension is most useful when writing HTML documents.  If youhave a graphic in PICT format and don't want to take the time (yet) toconvert it to PNG, GIF, or JPEG format, then you can still view it in HTMLViewer.  To do so, you must rename the file with the "<SAMP>.pict</SAMP>"extension, as HTML Viewer determines the type of a graphic file using itsextension. You then use the standard method for including an inline image:</P><PRE>	...&lt;IMG SRC = "my_graphic.pict"&gt;...</PRE><P>Since other browsers do not support PICT files, you should convert anyof these images to PNG, GIF, or JPEG format before distributing yourHTML document.</P><H5> The NOTE Markup </H5><P>The HTML 3.0 <SAMP>&lt;NOTE&gt;</SAMP> markup is also supported.  Thisisn't really an extension specific to HTML Viewer, but the popular browsersdo not yet support it, nor do they really ignore it the way you would wantthem to.  You can use one of three standard note icons, or customize the notewith your own graphic.  Here are the standard icons:</P><NOTE ROLE=SIMPLE> A simple note (default, <SAMP>ROLE=SIMPLE</SAMP>,	<SAMP>ROLE=NOTE</SAMP>) </NOTE><NOTE ROLE=CAUTION> A cautionary note (<SAMP>ROLE=CAUTION</SAMP>) </NOTE><NOTE ROLE=WARNING> A warning note (<SAMP>ROLE=WARNING</SAMP>) </NOTE><P>The HTML documentation that I've read is unclear about whether <SAMP>ROLE</SAMP>or <SAMP>CLASS</SAMP> is the proper way to specify which standard icon youwant to use, so I allow both attributes.  <SAMP>ROLE</SAMP> always takesprecedence if you have both attributes in <SAMP>NOTE</SAMP> a markup.This might be desirable, because the <SAMP>CLASS</SAMP> attribute is usedby OO HTML to "subclass" markup elements.</P><NOTE>	<P>	You can have multi-line notes, and the text will be indented	by one tab while the note icon remains aligned to the left margin.	</P>	<P>	Notes can also have multiple paragraphs.  To create multiple	paragraphs, use the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> and <SAMP>&lt;/P&gt;</SAMP>	markups.  Be careful with this option, as the result can sometimes be	confusing.  It might appear like are multiple notes with the icons	missing on all but the first one (this example is a case in point).	</P></NOTE><P>If the standard icons just don't do it for you, you can always useyour own graphic.  For best results, the graphic should be <EM>lessthan</EM> 32 pixels wide.  To specify a custom graphic, simply usesomething like the following:</P><PRE>	...&lt;NOTE SRC="my_icon.png"&gt; this is a note &lt;/NOTE&gt;...</PRE><P>You can use the <SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP> attribute when you use a customgraphic, but not when you use one of the standard icons.  However,the alignment is done on the first line, not for the whole note asyou might expect.  Stick with <SAMP>ALIGN=BASELINE</SAMP> and<SAMP>ALIGN=BOTTOM</SAMP> and you won't be surprised by the outcome.</P><P>One way to get notes to appear reasonably well in other browsersis to use the paragraph markups (<SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> and<SAMP>&lt;/P&gt;</SAMP>) to surround each paragraph (even if thereis only one) in each note.  This syntax is neither required norprohibited by HTML.</P><H5> The FOOTNOTE Markup </H5><P>Another HTML 3.0 markup that HTML Viewer supports is <SAMP>&lt;FOOTNOTE&gt;</SAMP>,the footnote markup.  Footnotes are most useful for simple term definitionsand explanations where definition lists are too formal and where linking toanother location in the document would break the flow of the text.  Like the<SAMP>&lt;NOTE&gt;</SAMP> markup, other browsers do not yet support footnotes.</P><P>Clicking on a hypertext link that refers to a footnote will display thetext of the footnote in a <A HREF="#fn_1">popup window</A>.  The windowwill be resized to fit the footnote text, and can be dismissed byclicking in the window.  The text of a footnote will not appear in themain text of the document.</P><P>Take a look at the source HTML for this document to see one way you canmake footnotes "backward compatible" with older browsers.  The markupsthat make the older browsers do the right thing are ignored by HTML Viewerin the context of a footnote.</P><H5> The DINGBAT Attribute </H5><P>Just one more feature from HTML 3.0, I promise.  The <SAMP>DINGBAT</SAMP>attribute is useful for embedding standard images into your document, andcan be used within <SAMP>IMG</SAMP>, <SAMP>NOTE</SAMP>, <SAMP>UL</SAMP>,and <SAMP>LI</SAMP> (within unordered lists) markups.  Here's a list ofdingbats that are currently available in HTML Viewer:</P><UL><LI DINGBAT=SOUND> <SAMP>DINGBAT=AUDIO</SAMP> or <SAMP>DINGBAT=SOUND</SAMP> </LI><LI DINGBAT=FILE> <SAMP>DINGBAT=FILE</SAMP> </LI><LI DINGBAT=FOLDER> <SAMP>DINGBAT=FOLDER</SAMP> </LI><LI DINGBAT=PROGRAM> <SAMP>DINGBAT=PROGRAM</SAMP> (non-standard) </LI><LI DINGBAT=APPLE> <SAMP>DINGBAT=APPLE</SAMP> (non-standard) </LI><LI DINGBAT=NOTE> <SAMP>DINGBAT=NOTE</SAMP> </LI><LI DINGBAT=CAUTION> <SAMP>DINGBAT=CAUTION</SAMP> </LI><LI DINGBAT=WARNING> <SAMP>DINGBAT=WARNING</SAMP> </LI></UL><P>I've looked for a list of standard dingbats, but all I could find werevague references to dingbats mentioning <SAMP>FOLDER</SAMP> and<SAMP>FILE</SAMP>.  It seemed fair to include the icons from the<SAMP>NOTE</SAMP> markup.  When I find a longer list, HTML Viewer willsupport more dingbats.  Dingbats that are not supported by a certainbrowser should be replaced by the standard unordered list graphic(typically, this is the bullet character), or by the standard note iconwhen used in a note.</P><H2><A NAME="" ISIX></A><A NAME="Revision History" ISIX> Revision History </A></H2><BR><UL><B>1.2.5</B> (6/18/96)<LI>New windows default to the "natural" size for their
