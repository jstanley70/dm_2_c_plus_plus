<HEAD><B>Dislocations and Image Contrast:</B></HEAD>Dislcoations are a type of line defect in a crystal.  They have displacement fields which are<BR> continuously distributed througout the crystal.  Since contrast in an electron micrograph will <BR>depend on the relative displacment of atoms about their position with respect to a perfect lattice,<BR>the complex nature and long range perturbations generated by a dislocation leads to complex images in an electron micrograph.Dislocations can be characterized by the  Burgers vector <B>b</B> and the dislocation line direction <B>u</B>.<BR>
