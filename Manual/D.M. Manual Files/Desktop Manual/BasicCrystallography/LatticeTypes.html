Space group numbers go from 195 to 230. Identifyingsymmetry is 4 - 3-fold axis.<BR>2.	.i.Tetragonal:Definition; unit cells have lattice parameters designatedby a = b  c, a = b = g = 90&#176;. Space group numbers go from 75 to 142.Identifying symmetry is the 1 - fourfold axis of symmetry.<BR>3.	.i.Orthorhombic:Definition; unit cells have lattice parameters designatedby a  b  c, a = b = g = 90&#176;. Space group numbers go from 16 to 74.The identifying symmetry is the 3-2 fold orthogonal axis of symmetry.<BR>4.	.i.Trigonal:Definition; unit cells have lattice parameters designatedby a = b  c, a = b = 90&#176;, g = 120&#176;.. Space group numbers go from143 to 167. Identifying symmetry is one 3 fold axis.<BR>5.	.i.Rhombohedral Setting:Definition; unit cells have lattice parametersdesignated by a = b = c, a = b = g  90&#176;. These are a subset of thetrigonal family. Desktop Microscopist provides an easy method for switchingbetween the settings. Clicking on the [ Rhomb.-&gt;Trig.] button will converta Rhombohedral setting to the trigonal. This button only appears when the appropriate crystal family is selected.<BR>6.	.i.Monoclinic:Definition; unit cells have lattice parameters designatedby a  b  c, , a = b = 90&#176;, g  90&#176;. Space group numbers go from3 to 15. Identifying symmetry is one 2 fold axis of symmetry.<BR>7.	.i.Triclinic:Definition; unit cells have lattice parameters designatedby a  b  c , a  b  g  90&#176;. Space group numbers go from 1 to 2.<BR>8.	.i.Hexagonal:Definition; unit cells have lattice parameters designatedby a = b  c , a = b = 90&#176;, g = 120&#176;. Space group numbers go from168 to 191. Identifying symmetry is one 6-fold axis.<BR><BR>444.
