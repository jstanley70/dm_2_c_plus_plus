Here heis on a night out with the family to see the Children's Christmas concertput on by the Portland Symphony Orchestra after a hard day developing newand interesting tools for the world's <A HREF="http://www.iucr.ac.uk/">crystallographers</A>.<BR><BR>Jim's interests include object oriented database technology for the materialsciences (he blames<A HREF="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/DISC/people/maier.html">Dave Maier</A> for this), <A HREF="../BasicCrystallography/Intro.html">crystallography</A>,thermodynamics, particle-wave interactions in the solid state and the designof intelligent interfaces to enhance the efficiency, the pleasure and theaccuracy of materials characterization. In addition, he'd <B>really, REALLY</B>like to design a killer material science educational game. <BR><BR>His current focus is completion of Desktop Microscopist 2.0. This majorenhancement to D.M. 1.x will include additional search capability, dislocationimage simulation, CBED dynamic calculations, Monte Carlo simulation, improveddata extraction, tilt control etc. <BR><BR><A HREF="../DesktopManual/Introduction/NewWithTwo.html"><IMG SRC="FrontPageImages/DesktopLogo.gif"ALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Complete ListOf Desktop Microscopist 2.0 capabilites. <TABLE BORDER> <CAPTION><FONT SIZE="4"><B>ExamplesOf New Capabilities of Desktop 2.0</B></FONT></CAPTION> <TR><TD><IMG SRC="FrontPageImages/MonteCarlo.gif" ALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="153" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></TD><TD>Monte Carlo Simulation</TD><TD><IMG SRC="FrontPageImages/Streak.gif"ALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="111" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></TD><TD>PrecipitateStreaking</TD> <TR><TD> <IMG SRC="FrontPageImages/CBED2.gif" ALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="52" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></TD> <TD>This is A DynamicallyCalculated HOLZ Spot</TD> <TD><A HREF="../BasicCrystallography/CBEDExplain.html"><IMG SRC="FrontPageImages/CBED.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="71" HEIGHT="73" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></TD> <TD>This is A Dynamically Calculated Central Spot</TD> </TR><TR> <TD><IMG SRC="FrontPageImages/dislocation.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="95" HEIGHT="51" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></TD> <TD>This is A Dynamically CalculatedDislocation Image<BR>Desktop 2.0 Currently Supports 2-Beam Calculations</TD> </TR> </TABLE> <TABLE BORDER><TR><TD><IMG SRC="FrontPageImages/Thru%20Tilt.gif" ALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="273"HEIGHT="243" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></TD><TD><IMG SRC="FrontPageImages/Thruthickness.gif"ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="273" HEIGHT="243" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></TD></TR> <TR><TD>Youcan also get an intensity vs. tilt Plot<BR>(Rocking Curve)</TD><TD> Also, Thru Thickness plots are available.
