These specifiedorientations could be a particular zone axis or an extact condition of excitation(say a two beam, Bragg or 2-Bragg condition).  Desktop gives the crystallographera unique tool to help save countless hours of frustration this is the <A HREF="../Desktop%20Objects/DataInputObjects.html">StageObject.</A>  Access the Stage Object by the opening the  <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Stage%20Control%20Dialog%20Box.html">StageObject Dialog Box.  <BR><BR></A>To set up Desktop Microscopist to allow tilts to be accurately determined,the following steps need to be taken:<OL>  <LI>You must align Desktop Microscopist's tilt axes with the Microscope. (This operation is a one time operation for each camera length, given astable lens system and a stable tilt holder).  One method, that does workis to:   <OL>    <LI>put a sample into the microscope which has reasonably sharp featureswhich move with the crystal.  (The best feature would be sharp central diskHOLZ lines or a relatively sharp kikuchi band. )     <LI>	Set the experimental stage at (0,0).      <LI>Take an exposure. (either electronically or with film.)    <LI>Tilt the x-axis in a positive direction to obtain significant movementin the sharp feature but still retaining the feature of interest in theview field.(The x-axis is the axis of the holder's rod.)    <LI>Take another exposure.     <LI>Superimpose the images and determine angle between the <A HREF="../Tutorial/DesktopMicGlossary.html">directionof tilt</A> and  an horizontal line appropriate to the user.    <LI>Go to the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Stage%20Control%20Dialog%20Box.html">StageObject Dialog Box.</A> click on the Setup check box.    <LI>When, the Beta box appears insert this angle into the box.    <LI>Determine if the positive tilt diretion of the x-axis with respectto the y-axis gives a z-axis going into or out of the view plane(computerscreen).  If out of the screen, +Y must be checked.  </OL>  <LI>Now, you must align the sample of interest with the matrix crystalin Desktop Microscopist.  <OL>    <LI>Insert the crystal parameters for the experimental crystal intothe Matrix <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/CrystalDefDialog.html">Unit Cell DialogBox </A>.    <LI>Rotate the crystal to an exact orientation, such as a zone axisusing the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamOrientationDialog.html">Beam OrientationDialog Box.</A>    <LI>Insert the experimental stage x-y tilt values into the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Stage%20Control%20Dialog%20Box.html">StageObject Dialog Box.</A>    <LI>Calculate this zone axis in Desktop Microscopist SAD/CBED objectwindow by orienting the crystal using the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamOrientationDialog.html">BeamOrientation Dialog Box</A> .    <LI>Rotate the pattern so that the complete set of g-vectors are coincidentwith the calculated patterns.  (You may use either the Rotate Pattern optionfound under the <A HREF="../Menu%20Items/SADMenuItems.html">Info Menu </A>oryou can set the required rotation in the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamOrientationDialog.html">BeamOrientation Dialog Box</A> )    <LI>Congratulations, you ready to spend time in Reciprocal Space!  </OL>  <LI>At this point, you may want toset the Default Object Values to thecurrent object values using the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Default-%3EPreferenceDialog.html">Default&lt;-&gt;CurrentDialog Box.</A>    <LI>Now, use the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Stage%20Control%20Dialog%20Box.html">StageObject Dialog Box.</A> to calculate tilts to a pole of interest, or usethe Beam Dir. Button in the Stage Object Dialog Box to calculate an exactirrational zone axis, or go an obect of interest and move the cursor aroundto read off addition zone axis or orientations.<BR><BR></OL><B>ONCE THE CRYSTAL IS ALIGNED TO THE STAGE OBJECT, DO NOT USE THE BEAMORIENTATION DIALOG BOX!!!! </B> If, you do you will lose the alignment.<BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual<BR></A><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: VirtualLabs</A><BR>Last Updated:July 6,1996</I> </BODY></HTML>
