These dialogboxes are covered under the menus which are activated in the new window.<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image122.gif" WIDTH="498" HEIGHT="150"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><H3><CENTER>Search Paths Dialog Box</CENTER></H3>The Search Paths Dialog box is used to specify the storage and retrievallocations for the data and documents supported or utilized by Desktop Microscopist.In order to keep the data types separate while simultaneously allowing accessto write protected media (such as CD ROMs), five search paths are defined,they are:<BR><BR><B>EDD, CHEMxx &amp;TN700: </B><BR><BR>This is the primary search location for the Electron Diffraction Database.It is used when matching up experimental data to the EDD.<BR><BR><B>EDD, CODENS:</B><BR><BR>This path is used to indicate the location of the CODENS file. This fileis used in the search / match functions and is also accessed by the bibliographicdata module of the crystal definition function.<BR><BR><B>Desktop Crystals:</B><BR><BR>This is the default search path for the storage and retrieval of DesktopMicroscopist crystals. Modification of this path provides an easy methodfor the support of multiple personal crystal libraries within a work group.This is also the location which will be searched from the search / matchroutines when the Desktop Crystals item is checked.<BR><BR><B>Phase Diagrams:</B><BR><BR>This is the location of the Phase Diagrams file, or in future versions theactive Phase Diagram library.<BR><B>Desktop Docs:</B><BR><BR>This is the default location for the storage and retrieval of Desktop Microscopistdocuments.<BR><BR>The text to the right of the Set buttons is the ASCII representation ofthe particular search path. To modify the search path, click on the setpath and then use the standard file interface to navigate to the desiredlocation on disk. Once this has been accomplished press Save and the newpath will have been entered. The directories are stored as alias recordsand are automatically updated whenever the program is run. As a result,once a directory has been identified as the target for a search path, thatpath should remain intact, even if the directory is moved.<BR><BR>Once all of the necessary paths have been specified, clicking OK causesthem to be activated.<BR><BR>Users connected to a network should be aware that an attempt will be madeto locate the specified storage device even if it is no longer connectedto the network. If the device cannot be found a dialog requesting the devicewill appear. If this occurs, either mount the device or simply ignore thedialog and continue as described above.<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image123.gif" WIDTH="351" HEIGHT="247"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.amesT.
