This activates the .i.Real Lattice:Select Atoms; dialog box.The Select Atoms dialog works by either hiding or showing an iterative selectionof atoms. Thus, if all the atoms are initially hidden, defining a selectionrange and then clicking on the Apply button with the Show radio button activewill show all the atoms which meet the defined selection criteria. Additionalatoms may be added by changing the selection criteria and again clickingon the Apply button.<BR><BR>The utilization of this dialog box provides a method of specifying any groupingof atoms from the initial lattice. <BR><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image183.gif" WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> When this radio button is active, all atoms which meetthe selection criteria will be displayed when the Apply button is activated.Atoms which are currently displayed but do not meet the selection criteriawill not be hidden..i.Real Lattice:Select Atoms Dialog:Show;<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image184.gif" WIDTH="49" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">When this radio button is active, all atoms which meetthe selection criteria will be hidden when the Apply button is activated.RealLattice:Select Atoms Dialog:Hide<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image185.gif" WIDTH="324" HEIGHT="76"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>This set of options sets the logic for selecting the atoms to be hiddenor displayed. .i.Real Lattice:Select Atoms Dialog:Selection Criteria; <UL>  <LI>The z direction is perpendicular to the plane of the screen so thatthe effected atom planes are parallel to the screen face. These atom planeswill be effected by the Z criteria.   <LI>The x direction is horizontal and within the plane of the screen.Atoms in the vertical plane extending orthogonally to the screen face areeffected by the X criteria.   <LI>The y direction is vertical and within the plane of the screen. Atomsin the horizontal plane extending orthogonally to the screen face are effectedby the Y criteria.   <LI>These controls allow the specification of apertures for the inclusionor exclusion of atoms for display. These apertures in conjunction with therotational capabilities of the Real Lattice provide the mechanism for thedisplay of any set of atomic planes. </UL><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image186.gif" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="57"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>The rotate controls pictured above provide the ability rotate the latticeinto a desired orientation for subsequent selections. This rotation occursfrom within the dialog box. .i.Real Lattice:Select Atoms Dialog:Rotation;<BR><BR>Note: The x, y and z axes used for specifying the atoms to be displayedare screen relative. Rotation of the lattice causes these axes to alignwith different crystallographic directions.<UL>  <LI>Clicking on the .i.Real Lattice:Select Atoms Dialog:Auto Shrink; buttonwill cause the dialog box to shrink to a very small size after an operationwhich effects the display of the lattice. This shrinking allows the resultsof the operation to be fully viewed. Clicking on the grow box will restorethe dialog to its original configuration.   <LI>The .i.Real Lattice:Select Atoms Dialog:Show All; and .i.Real Lattice:SelectAtoms Dialog:Hide All; buttons do as they indicate. Use them to reset thecrystal so that the show and hide radio buttons are effective.   <LI>The OK button retains the changes made to the dialog box while theCancel button restores the displayed lattice without any hidden atoms. </UL><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
