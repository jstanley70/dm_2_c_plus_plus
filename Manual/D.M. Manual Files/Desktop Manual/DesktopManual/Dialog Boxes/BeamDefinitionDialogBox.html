To do this you need to activatethe Beam Definition Dialog Box. From the Beam Definition Dialog Box youcan activate functions for definition the three beams.<BR><BR>These three dialog boxes allow the definition of the wavelength, the convergenceangle, the camera constant, the exposure time, the size of the exposed material(negative) and the response curve of the recording medium. For the caseof the x-ray beam, both a maximum accelerating voltage and a characteristicx-ray wavelength are entered. For the electron beam, the maximum acceleratingvoltage is specified. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image103.gif" WIDTH="522" HEIGHT="296"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Beam Definition Dialog Box Setup for Electron Case.</CENTER><H3><CENTER>Electron Beam Definition</CENTER></H3><B><I>PATH...Parameter Menu:Define Beam:&lt;Select Electron From Beam TypePopup <BR>Menu&gt;</I></B><BR>Set the Accelerating Voltage; either by using the <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image104.gif"WIDTH="53" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">pop-up menu whichhas a stored selection of common accelerating voltages or numerically inthe Electron Beam Definition:Accelerating Voltage; field of the Dialog Box.The accelerating voltage is used to determine the wavelength of the electron.See the chapter on <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Math.html">Mathematicsof Desktop Microscopist </A>for a detailed explanation of how the wavelengthis calculated. The Wavelength calculation is based on the relativistic effects.<BR><BR>The Negative Width; and Negative Height; determine how much of the screenis used to plot a given diffraction pattern. This can be extremely usefulwhen working with complicated crystals.<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image105.gif" WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This button changes the camera constant field to thecorresponding camera length. The .i.camera constant ;and/or camera lengthessentially determine the magnification of the diffraction pattern. Thecamera constant, the negative size and the wavelength determine the totalnumber of hkl values which are evaluated in the diffraction objects.<BR><BR>The .i.Convergence Angle; has two purposes. The first purpose is to setthe size of the diffraction disks in the CBED object and can be measuredfrom an experimental diffraction pattern. The second purpose is to set thesize of the Bulls-eye for experimental determination of d-spacings and anglesbetween diffraction intensity maximum. (This is explained in more detailin the section on Cursors in Chapter VI.) The greater the convergence anglethe larger the disk and bulls-eye diameter. <BR><BR>Dynamic Range; and .i.Relative Exposure; control the size and relative numberof diffraction spots which are plotted by Desktop Microscopist. The greaterthe dynamic range the more compressed the intensity response curve and thegreater the number of plotted spots. The equation for this function is documentedin the section on Mathematics. The Relative Exposure is used to set themaximum size of a diffracting spot. Typical values for the dynamic rangeare 1.5 and the relative exposure is 1.0.<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image106.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This button sets the global default values to the currentlydefined values. <BR><BR><A HREF="x-rayDefinitionDialogBox.html">To X-Ray Definition Dialog Box</A><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
