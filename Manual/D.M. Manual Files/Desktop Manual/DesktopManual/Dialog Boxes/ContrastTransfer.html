These values are used todevelop the Envelope Function to model the attenuation of the Lens as aradial function.  Clicking on Delta Voltage will allow the user to inputa single value (The Chromatic Spread) to model the attenuatioin.  DeltaVoltage refers to the average fluctuations in the Accelerating Voltage andis normalized to the current Accelerating Voltage.  Delta Current referestto the average fluctuations in the Lens Current given in picoAmps.<BR><BR>The <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image347.gif" WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> gives the cutoff radius of the hat functionx = 1 for x &lt;= Radius, x =  0 for x &gt; Radius.  The radius is givenin millimeters refered to the projected size at the given camera length. Its distance in  reciprocal angstroms is given by Radius/ Camera Constant.<BR>The <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image350.gif" WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> is determined as half the difference in defocusbetween the major and minor axis of the distorted image and is given inmillimeters based on the conversion to the current camera length.<BR><BR>The Stigmatic Angle refers to the angle from symmetric through which theCTF is calculated.  To see the effect of the coefficient of astigmatism(Ca) on the CTF calculated it at various angles.  The <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image348.gif"WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> button willcause the CTF to be continually calculated at increasing angles.  Clickingon the <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image349.gif" WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">button a second time will cause the calculationsto stop.<BR>Clicking on the Defocus button will cause the CTF to be calculated at decreasingdefocus.  Divergence is a measure of the inability of the microscope toinsure all beams are parallel to the optical axis.  Again, it is measuredin mm based on a conversion of angle to millimeters by virtue of the cameralength.<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image351.gif" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="157"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>The Table of Values are the following.</CENTER><UL>  <LI>Pt. to Pt Res. is the point to point resolution of the microscopeand is primarily associated with the maximum reciprocal distance beforethe CTF changes sign at Scherzer Defocus.  <LI><BR>  <LI>Info.
