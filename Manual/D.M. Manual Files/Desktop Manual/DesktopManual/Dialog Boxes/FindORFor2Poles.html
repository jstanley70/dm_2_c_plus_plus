It requires a zone axis from eachcrystal and the rotation between these two axis.

The user has no control overthese buttons.  However, the values may change of an Orientation Relationshipis added to the list under the following rules:<UL>  <LI>	If, there is no matrix crystal.  The first crystal is selected tobe the matrix crystal.  The crystal data for this experimental pole is copiedinto the matrix crystal and the orientation relationship is determined withthis as the matrix crystal.<BR>If, they are both matrix crystals.  The second crystal is selected to bethe first precipitate crystal.   The crystal data for this experimentalpole is copied into the first precipitate crystal and the orientation relationshipis determined with this as the first precipitate crystal.</UL><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image312.gif" WIDTH="183" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> This brings up the <B><A HREF="OrientationMatrix.html">OrientationMatrix Dialog Box</A></B>.  However, this activation of the OrientationMatrix Dialog Box is different that the other activations.  The Matriceswhich are displayed given the relationship between the two crystals basedon the second crystal.  The values are determined by taking the Inverseroataion matrix for the first crystal, multiply it by the second crystal'srotation matrix, then display the values with respect to the second crystal.<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image313.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="54" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> This box allows the user to allow a wider margin ofdifference between the two crystal's poles.  (The way orientation relationship'sare calculated is by generating plane and direction stereograms for eachcrystal and then finding all poles for each crystal within X&#176; of eachother.)<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image314.gif" WIDTH="119" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This sets the size of the stereograms calculated.  Avalue of 2 would generate stereograms from -2-2-2 to 222 for each crystal.<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image315.gif" WIDTH="388" HEIGHT="72" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> This is a standard <A HREF="../Desktop%20Objects/Datapresentationdevices.html">TextTable object</A> that displays all found potential orientation relationships. Select a cell selects an orientation relationship which is displayed under:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image316.gif" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>To set this orientation into Desktop Microscopist for additional calculationsclick the <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image317.gif" WIDTH="62" HEIGHT="21"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">.<BR>When finished with the Dialog simply click the <B>Done </B>button.<BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
