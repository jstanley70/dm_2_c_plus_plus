Proper use of this dialog box helps Desktop Microscopistaccurately calculate diffraction patterns for twins, crystals related bya martensitic transformation and solid state precipitates. It is possibleto define rational (standard solid state precipitation reactions) and irrationalorientation relationships. Setting a rational orientation relationship isaccomplished by setting parallel two sets of two non-tangential planes ordirections, one from each crystal. This action is described in figure 6.An irrational orientation relationship is described by first orienting theplanes, as for a rational orientation relationship and then rotating thecrystals about the first axis (either the plane normal pole or the direction)of the matrix crystal and then rotating the crystals about the second axisof the matrix. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image14.gif" WIDTH="397" HEIGHT="162"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>1. There is a great deal of flexibility in setting a rational orientationrelationship. It is possible to set either planes or directions parallelin any paired combination and the two sets of planes/directions need notbe orthogonal. The only requirement for accurate calculation of the orientationmatrix is that the angular relationship between the matrix poles be thesame as the angular relationship between the precipitate poles. For example,it is permissible to define the following relationship for 2 cubic crystals:<BR><P><CENTER>100&gt;matrix || 011&gt;ppt<BR>(110)matrix || (001)ppt </CENTER><P>(the angle between the plane normal and the direction is 45&#176; forboth crystals). However, the relationship: <BR><P><CENTER>&lt;100&gt;matrix || &lt;011&gt;ppt <BR>(011)matrix || (001)ppt cannot be defined. </CENTER><P>While in theory there is a great deal of flexibility, in practice itis strongly suggested that an orientation relationship be defined whichuses a direction set and a plane set of poles which are orthogonal (dotproduct = 0). Following this simple rule will eliminate any potential difficultiesthat may occur with respect to accurate representation. <BR><BR>For purposes of this demonstration, set the following orientation relationship:<BR><P><CENTER>100&gt;matrix || 0-1-1&gt;ppt <BR>(011)matrix || (100)ppt </CENTER><P>Setting this relationship is very similar to setting the atomic positionsin the Crystal dialog box. Simply click on the values to change and typein the proper information. However, the following points need to be made:<UL>  <LI>Clicking on the enter box when the parallel column is active willchange the value Plane to Direction and vice versa.
