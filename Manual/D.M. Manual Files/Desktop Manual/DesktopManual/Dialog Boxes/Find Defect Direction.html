One additional use is in the analysisof defect structure. It is common to use the stereographic projection inconjunction with TEM micrographs of dislocation structures to determinethe direction vector for a dislocation line. The knowledge of the crystalorientation determined from the diffraction pattern, and the projectionof the dislocation from two orientations of the crystal uniquely determinethe dislocation direction. Desktop Microscopist simplifies this task bystreamlining the orienting of a crystal and immediately returning the Millerindex at the cross-over of the two dislocation projections. This analysismay be obtained by going to the Function menu and selecting Find a DefectDirection... This will bring up a dialog box which will allow the definitionof two orientations for the stereogram. The functionality of this dialogbox is identical to that of the<A HREF="Add%20Defect%20Trace.html"> DefectTrace Dialog</A> with the added ability of being able to automatically determinethe intersection of the resultant traces. <A HREF="../Tutorial/DefectAnalysisTut.html">Seetutorial with a step by step example of the use.</A><BR><BR>The true direction of the dislocation is that of the pole which occurs atthe intersection of the traces.
