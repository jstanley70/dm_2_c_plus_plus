Desktop Microscopist supports one crystal at a time for real latticeplotting. Desktop Microscopist will display a unit cell which is comprisedof the atoms which are less than a lattice translation vector from the origin.Desktop Microscopist will also display a unit lattice. A unit lattice correspondsto the typical lattice display with additional atoms plotted if they areless than or equal to a lattice translation vector from the origin. It willalso plot a 2x2x2 (8 unit cell), a 4x4x4 (64 unit cell) display, or a crystalwith a shape defined by the Crystal Shape Dialog Box..i.Real Lattice:SetupDialog:Crystal Selection;<BR><BR>Desktop Microscopist has the capability to display the atoms either as aball &amp; stick (atomic radii are divided by 2) or in hard ball mode (atomicradii are as given in the Desktop Microscopist Database on Atomic information).Desktop Microscopist also allows the user to select which radius will beused for display of neutral atoms. These choices are covalent, metallicand van der Waals. If there is no corresponding entry for a given element,Desktop Microscopist will default to the covalent value. If a van der Waalradius is selected and there is no value for that particular atom, thenthe covalent value is selected. If the atom has been defined as an ion,the ionic value is always given. If there is no value available for theparticular ionic state, Desktop Microscopist will default to the covalentvalue. Use the Atomic Info Dialog box to view the stored radii for a givenatom. Finally, Desktop Microscopist does allow specific scaling for latticeplots. .i.Real Lattice:Setup Dialog:Display <BR>Type Real Lattice:Setup Dialog:Atomic Radii;<BR><BR>Note: The default real lattice plot will look very flat on a color monitor.This is because it has not been rendered. To view a rendered plot it isnecessary to select the Render Plot option under the Lattice Menu.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
