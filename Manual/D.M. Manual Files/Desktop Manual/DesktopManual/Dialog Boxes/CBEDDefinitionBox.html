The Plot definition dialog boxes for the SAD, CBED, Laue Back-scatteredand Laue Transmission patterns are identical and found under the Definemenu by selecting the Define Pattern... menu item or similar command.<BR>1. Use the Definition Box to determine which crystal diffraction intensitieswill be plotted, the orientation of the calculated crystal set, the widthof the calculated intensity spread (streaking) and whether to display theplotted intensity in the crystal's associated color or with an intensitybased linear grey map.<BR>1. .i.SAD:Setup Dialog:Zone Axis;.i.CBED:Setup Dialog:Zone Axis;.i.Laue:SetupDialog:Zone Axis;The crystals are selected for plotting by checking theappropriate box. The Zone Axis editable text box is used to set the orientationof the crystal. The zone axis indicated is for the first selected crystal.If the Ppt. 1 crystal is checked but not the Matrix crystal, Desktop Microscopistwill calculate the appropriate diffraction pattern with the PPt. 1 orientedparallel to the zone axis. However, if the Ppt. 2 crystal is also checked,the orientation of both crystals will be with respect to the Matrix.<BR>I. Use the grey scale option to view the crystal with the spot intensitybased on the relative calculated intensity. This feature is especially usefulfor CBED patterns where the relative intensities are easier to visualize.<BR>I. On occasion it may be desirable to visualize a crystal's diffractionpattern in an orientation that is slightly skewed with respect to a lowerorder zone axis. Desktop Microscopist accomplishes this by defining an IrrationalZone Axis. <BR><BR>The final observation with respect to this dialog box concerns the methodologiesused to determine which diffraction spots will be plotted. If the EwaldSphere construction were held to a strict geometrical interpretation, itwould be impossible to observe a zone axis pattern where rows of reciprocallattice points can be observed. The intersection of a sphere with a planeof diffraction spots in reciprocal space defines a set of points that issmaller than typically observed. This is overcome by allowing these planesof spots to have thickness. Applying this third dimension provides the conditionwhereby observed diffraction patterns can be formed. The 3-D effect is dueto the spreading of intensity around each reciprocal lattice point. Thisspreading is estimated in Desktop Microscopist using two functions:<BR>II. The first function takes the stated thickness of the foil and the relationof the foil normal to the zone axis, calculates the thickness and determinesa spread which is inversely proportional to the value. The second methoduses the stated morphology of the precipitate crystal to calculate a streakingshape and the spread function in the desired direction. <BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
