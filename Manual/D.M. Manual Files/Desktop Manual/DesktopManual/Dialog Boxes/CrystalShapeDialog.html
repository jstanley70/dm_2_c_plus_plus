Thecrystal morphology consists of a set of plane faces and their distance fromthe origin specified as number of planes. For example, a value of 3 wouldindicate that the face of the crystal is three planes of the specified typeaway from the origin. The definition of the crystal origin is somewhat circularand is dependent on the defined crystal morphology. Given the definitionof the crystal morphology, the origin is defined as the point in space wherethe 001 g-vector, the 010 g-vector, and the 100 g-vector coincide as theirlengths approach zero.<BR><BR>Crystal morphology has limited use in Desktop Microscopist. It is used toshow the rotation of the crystal in real lattice, a Real Lattice plot ofthe crystal shape can also be created and it is used for the determinationof streaking in the diffraction pattern calculations.<BR><BR>In addition to defining a crystal morphology, the Crystal Face Dialog Box(Crystal Face Library) will also plot a representation of the crystal andallow limited rotation to aid in viewing the morphology. Finally, the Dialogbox supports both the storage and retrieval of crystal morphologies to acrystal shape library.<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image93.gif" WIDTH="53" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> and <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image94.gif" WIDTH="53"HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">These buttons are used toadd and subtract crystal faces. The Add button adds a duplicate of the lastcrystal face in the crystal face list whereas the Delete button deletesthe highlighted or active crystal face. .i.Crystal Shape:Dialog:Add;.i.CrystalShape:Dialog:Delete;<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image95.gif" WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This is the Crystal Shape Library Pop-up Menu. It allowsthe selection of stored crystal shapes. Desktop Microscopist comes withthe following standard crystal morphologies: Cubic (parallel piped), Octahedron,Rhombic, Dodecahedron, Tetrahedron, Cuboctahedron and Tetrakaidecahedron.Selecting a library entry will bring up the stored set of crystal facesand replaces the current list of plane faces. The number of planes for eachface is given the default value. .i.Crystal Shape:Dialog:Morphology Menu;<BR>II. The Calc. .i.Wigner-Seitz; Cell menu item will attempt to calculatethe Wigner-Seitz Cell for the reduced unit cell. The Wigner-Seitz cell isgenerated by drawing directions from the origin to the closest lattice pointsand then drawing the perpendicular bisecting plane..i.Crystal Shape:Dialog:Morphology Menu:Calc. Wigner-Seitz Cell;<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image96.gif" WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This button uses the hkl values in the current editabletext box and makes a list of the complete set of permuted planes. The sizeof the total permutation set is dependent on the crystal family and specifichkl value. Typically, it may be used as a simple method to insert a desiredset of crystal planes. The number of crystal planes will be the same asthe permuted crystal plane..i.Crystal Shape:Dialog:Permutate;<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image97.gif" WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">May be used after defining a new crystal morphologyto obtain a plot of the newly defined morphology..i.Crystal Shape:Dialog:Redraw;<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image98.gif" WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="99" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Use the four Rotate buttons to see the morphology fromdifferent views. The rotate buttons support rotation about two axes. Thefirst axis is out of the plane of the screen both clockwise and counterclockwise and the second axis is parallel to the screen and horizontal tothe bottom of the screen..i.Crystal Shape:Dialog:Rotate;<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image99.gif" WIDTH="105" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This final button will allow the currently defined crystalmorphology to be added to the library of crystal shapes. Click on the <A HREF="AddToCrystalShapeLib.html">AddTo Library</A> button and a small dialog box will appear which will allowthe labeling of the new crystal shape. The crystal shape library is storedas a resource file and is kept within Desktop Microscopist..i <BR><BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
