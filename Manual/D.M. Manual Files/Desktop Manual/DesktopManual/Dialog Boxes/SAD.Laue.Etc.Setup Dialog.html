If the Ppt.1 crystal is checked but not the Matrix crystal, Desktop Microscopist willcalculate the appropriate diffraction pattern with the PPt. 1 oriented parallelto the zone axis. However, if the Ppt. 2 crystal is also checked, the orientationof both crystals will be with respect to the Matrix.<BR><BR>Use the <B>grey scale option</B> to view the crystal with the spot intensitybased on the relative calculated intensity. This feature is especially usefulfor CBED patterns where the relative intensities are easier to visualize.<BR><BR><BR>The final observation with respect to this dialog box concerns the methodologiesused to determine which diffraction spots will be plotted. If. the EwaldSphere construction were held to a strict geometrical interpretation, itwould be impossible to observe a zone axis pattern where rows of reciprocallattice points can be observed. The intersection of a sphere with a planeof diffraction spots in reciprocal space defines a set of points that issmaller than typically observed. This is overcome by allowing these planesof spots to have thickness. Applying this third dimension provides the conditionwhereby observed diffraction patterns can be formed. The 3-D effect is dueto the spreading of intensity around each reciprocal lattice point. Thisspreading is estimated in Desktop Microscopist using two functions:<BR><BR>The first function takes the stated thickness of the foil and the relationof the foil normal to the zone axis, calculates the thickness and determinesa spread which is inversely proportional to the value. The second methoduses the stated morphology of the precipitate crystal to calculate a streakingshape and the spread function in the desired direction. <BR><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image157.gif" WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This check box activates the crystal morphology streakingcalculation.  It only effects the precipitate crystals.<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image304.gif" WIDTH="383" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Extra spots and concentrations of electrons, in addition to generation frominteraction with the average perfect lattice can be caused by many additionalsources, inelastic interactions, double diffraction, interactions with defectsand effects due to crystal size and shape and deviations due to interfaceinteractions. (See Elastic and Inelastic Scattering In Electron Diffractionand Imaging). With the advent of verison 2.0, Desktop Microscopist, it isnow possible to evaluate some of the effects caused by precipite shape andsize. When the <B>Full Streak Calcs.</B> option is activated a <A HREF="aauntitled_copy.html">Ppt.Streak Setup Dialog Box</A> will be displayed. After setting up the calculation,Desktop will calculate a fourier transform of the Crystal Shape definedin the Crystal Shape Dialog Box for any activated precipitate crystal. Thetransform will be rotated to the current orientation and slices centeredaround the distance from the Ewald sphere to reciprocal lattice points willbe displayed.<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image308.gif" WIDTH="458" HEIGHT="189"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><B>Schematic of the Calculation Process.</B><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image305.gif" WIDTH="46" HEIGHT="43" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Example of a calculated streaking pattern.<BR><BR><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image306.gif" WIDTH="336" HEIGHT="45" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Eample of a Through Series showing the change in the <BR>Shape Function as Distance From the Origin.</CENTER><P><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
