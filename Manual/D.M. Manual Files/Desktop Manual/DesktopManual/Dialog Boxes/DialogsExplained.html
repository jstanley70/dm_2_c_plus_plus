The standard format for each entry is: <MENU>Title of the Dialog Box.<BR>Path Descriptor.<BR>Brief description of the function of the dialog box.<BR>How it is accessed from within the program. <BR>Which objects are supported by the dialog box.<BR><BR>A listing of all of the commands within the dialog box. </MENU><H3>Understanding The Path Descriptor:</H3>The Path Descriptor describes how the Dialog Box may be accessed:<BR><BR>A set of Braces {...} specifies the object within which the given Dialogbox is found. Path items separated by colons indicate a menu path. A finaldescriptor encased in a set of parenthesis (...) indicates the Dialog boxis entered via the button whose name is listed within the parenthesis. Afinal descriptor encased in a set &lt;...&gt; indicates the Dialog box isentered via the item which is described within the &lt;..&gt;.<BR><BR><B>Standard Features of Dialog Boxes:</B> <UL>  <LI>Any button which is outlined may be activated by pressing the &lt;return&gt;key. <BR>An example is the <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image54.gif" WIDTH="68" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">button.   <LI>The <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image54.gif" WIDTH="68" HEIGHT="31"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> button always closes the dialog boxand saves any changes which were made while in the Dialog box.   <LI>The <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image55.gif" WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="27"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> button closes the dialog box and whenpossible returns the program to the state it was in prior to the openingof the dialog box. In other words, none of the changes made while in theDialog Box are implemented.   <LI>The <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image56.gif" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="31"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">box found in the upper left hand cornerof the dialog box has the same effect as the <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image57.gif"WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">button.   <LI>Dialog items which have a bottom, right shadow, such as <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image58.gif" WIDTH="57" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">are an indication that there is a pop-up menu choice. Pop-up menu contentsare listed and their effects are described in this chapter and not in thesection on menu items.   <LI>The <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image59.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="31"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">symbol is associated with an editabletextbox. Clicking on this box or pressing the &lt;enter&gt; key will enterthe value within the textbox into the associated list. The active cell isindicated by highlighting. </UL>The Dialog Boxes are organized by Object and then by Menu required to accessthe dialog boxes. Dialog Boxes which are activated while in another dialogbox are found immediately following the parent dialog box. Pop-up Menuswhich are found in a particular dialog box are described with the relevantdialog. <BR><BR><BR><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Go to Dialog List</A><BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual<BR></A><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: VirtualLabs</A><BR>Last Updated: June 6,1996</I> </BODY></HTML>
