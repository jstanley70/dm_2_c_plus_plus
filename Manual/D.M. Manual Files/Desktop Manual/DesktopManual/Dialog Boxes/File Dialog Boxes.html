The .i.Open ;dialog box is the standard Macintosh dialog box and willnot be described in detail in this manual. However, it should be noted thatthe Open dialog box will access both Desktop Microscopist Object informationfiles and files which store crystal information. When Desktop MicroscopistObjects are opened, a new window is created and the stored information isused to plot the stored data in the form in which it was saved. When openinga new crystal file, the Matrix Crystal Definition Dialog Box is opened forthe current window and the stored information replaces the current information.If there are no windows open the crystal information is stored in the defaultcrystal.<BR>1. The .i.File Menu:Dialog:Place ;Dialog Box has the same form as the Opendialog box; however, it will allow file types different from the two standardDesktop Microscopist File types, to be opened depending on the active window.The only additional file type supported is a PICT file from within an SADor SAD derived Object. <H3><CENTER>Save Dialog Box</CENTER></H3><B><I>PATH...File Menu:Save As <BR><P><CENTER></I></B><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image121.gif" WIDTH="361" HEIGHT="215" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><H3><CENTER>Save Dialog Box</CENTER></H3>I <BR><BR>The .i.File Menu:Dialog:Save ;dialog which is activated from the File Menu'sSave As item saves the current data into a Desktop Microscopist file. Tosave crystals independently of any other object information, they must besaved from within the Crystal Definition Dialog Box.<BR>1. Crystals should be saved into the Desktop Microscopist Crystals folderor a folder contained therein. This allows Desktop Microscopist to searchand match these crystals by chemistry and d-spacings. <H3><CENTER>Page Set-Up Dialog Box:</CENTER></H3><B><I>PATH...File Menu:Page Setup <BR><P><CENTER></I></B><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image118.gif" WIDTH="395" HEIGHT="142" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><H3><CENTER>Page Setup Dialog Box</CENTER></H3>I. The .i.Page Setup; dialog box which is accessed from the File Menu aidsin specifying the printing environment for Desktop Microscopist. UnlikeDiffract, Desktop Microscopist does not require that the Font Substitutionoption be disabled in order to obtain proper printing of overbars. DesktopMicroscopist uses the default page setup dialog boxes. <H3><CENTER>Print Dialog Box</CENTER></H3><B><I>PATH...File Menu:Print <BR><P><CENTER></I></B><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image119.gif" WIDTH="394" HEIGHT="137" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Fit Picture Dialog Box</CENTER><P>The Print command will attempt to print the contents of the current window.Unlike a typical Macintosh application, Desktop Microscopist does not supporta &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; print interface. Instead, DesktopMicroscopist provides several fixed output formats which are used dependingon the type of object being printed.<BR><BR>Objects derived from the Table object are printed in a fixed tabular form.The crystal object may be printed out while in the <A HREF="CrystalDefDialog.html">CrystalDefinition Dialog Box</A> and this printout is also in a set table format.Although the format is invariant, the actions taken to obtain a printoutare similar to other applications. The most significant difference is inthe appearance of an Alert box asking whether to re-size the plot such thatit is fitted to the page. This Alert box only affects windows which supporta re-sizing redraw such as the Stereographic Projection object. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
