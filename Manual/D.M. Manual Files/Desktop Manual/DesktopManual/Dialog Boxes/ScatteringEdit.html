Each element can haveits neutral scattering potential and its more common ionic state scatteringfactors stored within Desktop Microscopist. This Dialog Box is accessedfrom the Atomic Info Dialog box by clicking on the Atomic Scattering Factorbutton. Once in the Atomic Scattering Dialog, it is possible to view anyatomic scattering curve, both electron and x-ray, and to reset these values.It is also easy to add desired resources.  <LI>To specify a new scattering curve type in a new element in the Elementtext box or use the pop-up menu to select between the electron or x-rayscattering curves. (Ionic crystals are designated after the symbol. Example:Al+3. Absolute ionic states must be less than 10.)  <LI>After making the desired selections, click on the Get Resource button.If there is a curve already available the new values will appear in theatomic scattering list. However, if there are no lists stored in DesktopMicroscopist, the values will remain the same as the previous values. Typein the values for the new element state and click on the Set Resource buttonto define a new atomic scattering resource.</UL><I>Note: The atomic scattering values are in units of &Aring;-1 and arelisted as a function of s where s is defined as the value of sin(q)/l, whereq is the Bragg diffraction angle and l is the electron wavelength in &Aring;.<BR>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.
