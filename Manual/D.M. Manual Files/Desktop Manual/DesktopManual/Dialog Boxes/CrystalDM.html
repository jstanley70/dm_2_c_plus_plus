The menus are the <B>Apple Menu</B>, the <B>File Menu</B>,the <B>Edit Menu</B> and the <B>Parameter menu</B>. The menu labeled <B>Parameters</B>allows definition of most of the parameters necessary to describe a givencalculation. Under the parameters menu, the second item marked Define UnitCells provides a hierarchical menu with four choices. Selecting the choicemarked <B>Matrix... 1</B> will bring up the <A HREF="CrystalDefDialog.html">CrystalDefinition Dialog Box</A>. The next section is a step by step journey throughthe process necessary to completely define a unit cell <H3><CENTER>Defining Crystals</CENTER></H3><H3>1.

(Cubic, Tetragonal,Orthorhombic, Trigonal, Hexagonal, Monoclinic, Triclinic)   <LI>The <B>space group number</B>   <LI>The <B>lattice parameters</B>; (a,b,c and a,b,g)   <LI>The <B>atomic positions</B>, either by separate entry of individualatoms or by the use of group theory to fill in non-degenerate positions,generated by the appropriate symmetry operations.   <LI>The <B>element</B> associated with each atomic position includingfractional occupancies and partially filled sites.   <LI><B>Meta-data </B>such as periodical references, crystal name and chemicalformula.   <LI>The <B>color</B> associated with the crystal when plotting graphicalrepresentations of calculated data..i.Color;   <LI>The <B>Load and Dump</B> options allow the transfer (Dump) or replacement(Load) of the current crystal to or from any of the 4 (matrix and 3 precipitate)Default or Local crystals. Understanding the use of the load and dump optionsas well as Default vs Local parameters is critical to the effective utilizationof Desktop Microscopist. Because of its importance, this topic has a separatesection and is discussed throughout the manual. </OL><I>Not all of these options are immediately available in the Dialog Boxbut may be accessed by means of the appropriate button.</I> <H3>Example:</H3>The following example will be the definition of the tetragonal form of Al3Tias given in the 1985 edition of the<A HREF="../references.html"> Pearson'sHandbook of Crystallograph</A>y . Two different methods for obtaining thenecessary parameters will be reviewed. The first method will not take advantageof the use of space group theory to aid in the definition of the crystal.Each atomic position will be input by hand. The second method will utilizethe space group generators where Wyckoff positions are used to minimizeinput effort. <H3>Defining A Crystal Family</H3>To define the appropriate Crystal Family, click on the pop-up menu labeledCrystal Family. The initial default value is Cubic with the other sevencrystal families selections being: Cubic, Tetragonal, Orthorhombic, Hexagonal,Trigonal, Monoclinic and Triclinic. In addition, the Rhomb. Set. menu itemallows selection of the Rhombohedral setting for the Trigonal set of spacegroups. For purposes of this demonstration, <B>select the second item, Tetragonal.</B>On the line c = 2.000 &Aring;, the value 2.000 will have a text box aroundit indicating that it is now editable text. Selecting the crystal familydetermines the editable text boxes for defining the lattice parameters andthe range of available space groups. <B>The Crystal Family should be thefirst parameter set for a crystal</B>.<BR><I><BR>NOTE: For certain crystal families, for example the monoclinic system, the<A HREF="../references.html">International Tables of X-ray Crystallography</A>defines more than one setting for each space group. At this time, DesktopMicroscopist supports only the most common setting for each space group.If there is a question about which setting Desktop Microscopist uses inits definition, refer to the Space Group Tables found back in the Main Menuunder the Edit Menu to view a printout of the specific space group.</I><H3>After selecting the tetragonal crystal type, input the lattice parametersfor Al3Ti. </H3>These are a = 3.848 &Aring; and c = 8.596 &Aring;. The tab-key will movethe text cursor from editable text box to editable text box; alternatively,clicking the mouse in the text box will achieve the same thing. <H3>Entering Atomic Positions</H3>Desktop Microscopist allows the entering of atomic positions either individuallyor using the <A HREF="Wyckoff.html">Wyckoff Positions; or Point Sets;</A>.The Wyckoff Positions are sets of generators which have been determinedby members of the <A HREF="http://www.iucr.ac.uk/">International Committeeon Tables for Crystallography</A>. The generator set is fixed for each spacegroup. The first generator listed (the highest alpha numeric of the set)for each set is the general condition. Each subsequent generator is basedon the general condition, but eliminates any duplication caused by atomsplaced at special positions (such as the origin etc.). One advantage ofusing the Wyckoff Positions to define atomic positions is in the reducedwork necessary to input a group of atoms. Other advantages to the use ofspace groups in crystallography are discussed in any competent book on thesubject. An excellent starting point is the text:<A HREF="../references.html">SpaceGroups for Solid State Scientists</A>. Although the <A HREF="Wyckoff.html">WyckoffPosition Generators</A>; are normally used to quickly define a unit cell,for purposes of this tutorial, the atoms will be initially entered one ata time. The atomic positions for Al3Ti are: <TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TH>Element</TH> <TH> X</TH> <TH>Y</TH> <TH>Z</TH> <TH>Occupancy</TH><TH>Debye Waller Factor</TH></TR> <TR> <TD>Al</TD> <TD>0</TD> <TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD> <TD>100%</TD> <TD>0</TD></TR> <TR><TD>Al</TD> <TD>0.</TD> <TD>.5</TD><TD>.5</TD> <TD>100%</TD> <TD>0</TD></TR> <TR><TD>Al</TD> <TD>.5</TD> <TD>0</TD><TD>.5</TD> <TD>100%</TD> <TD>0</TD></TR> <TR><TD>Al</TD> <TD>.5</TD> <TD>.5</TD><TD>.5</TD> <TD>100%</TD> <TD>0</TD></TR> <TR><TD>Al</TD> <TD>.75</TD> <TD>.25</TD><TD>.75</TD> <TD>100%</TD> <TD>0</TD> <TR><TD> Al</TD><TD>.25</TD> <TD>.75</TD><TD>.25</TD> <TD>100%</TD> <TD>0</TD> <TR><TD> Ti</TD><TD>0</TD> <TD>0</TD><TD>0.</TD> <TD>100%</TD> <TD>0</TD> <TR><TD>TI</TD> <TD>.5</TD> <TD>.5</TD><TD>.5</TD> <TD>100%</TD> <TD> 0</TD> <CAPTION ALIGN="Bottom">Atomic Positionsfor Al3Ti</CAPTION> </TABLE> <BR>To input these positions into Desktop Microscopist, the total number ofatoms must first be specified. Clicking on the button marked<B> Set # Atoms</B>brings up the<A HREF="../ManualImages/SetNumAtomsDialog.html"> Set # Atomsdialog box</A>. <UL>  <LI>Set the number to 8 and either press <RETURN> or click on the OK button.The program will return to the crystal definition dialog box with sevenadditional Cu atoms positioned at the origin appearing in the Atomic PositionList box.   <LI>Under the Z column click on the first 0.000 value. 0.000 will appearand be selected (highlighted with a black background) in the editable textbox directly above the atomic position list.   <LI>Type in the value .5 and press the <ENTER> key or click on the smallbox to the right of the editable text box. This will enter the value .5into the previously selected atomic position and the next (element) positionwill be highlighted.   <LI>The value (Cu) will now appear in the editable text box. Type in eitherAl or AL into this box and press <ENTER>.   <LI>In this manner the remaining atomic positions may be specified. </UL><H4><A HREF="HybridAtom.html">Fractional Occupancy</A></H4><UL>  <LI>Before proceeding, the question of <B>occupancy</B> ;must be addressed.In general, most crystals are defined with each atom position having 100%occupancy.   <LI>Each atomic position is always filled by the designated atom.   <LI>However, in real materials, certain lattice sites may be only partiallyoccupied or occupancy may be shared by more than one element. Desktop Microscopisthandles this problem by allowing the definition of hybrid atoms <A HREF="HybridAtom.html">HybridAtom</A>; which are the weighted average of the occupying atoms. For eachcrystal, 29 different hybrid atoms are allowed, a hybrid atom can be usedas many times as required. A hybrid atom may contain up to 10 differentelements..   <LI>To define a hybrid atom, double click on the element symbol for thedesired atomic position and follow the directions. </UL><H3>Notes: </H3><UL>  <LI><I>The Atomic Position list box, although similar to a spreadsheet,does not support arrows, tab or the return key. </I>  <LI><I>Unlike Diffract, the number of atomic positions is not limitedto 250. Theoretically, as many as 32,000 atomic positions are available.In reality, memory and speed considerations provide practical limitations.</I></UL><H3>Inputting Ionic Elements</H3>Desktop Microscopist allows ionic elements; to be designated. To designatean ionic element, type in the elemental symbol and the ionic state. (Negativevalues must be indicated... Al2 will be converted to Al+2). <BR><I>An ionic state for an element may be entered even if there is no correspondingdata for that ionic state, in this case the parameters for the neutral atomwill be used for calculations.</I> <BR>Thus, if there are no atomic scattering factors currently stored for Al+2, diffraction patterns will be calculated using the scattering factors forAl; there will be no indication that this has occurred. <BR>Use the Atomic Info option under the Edit Menu to view parameters availablefor each element. Desktop Microscopist allows the editing of atomic scatteringvalues using the <A HREF="ScatteringEdit.html">atomic scattering dialogbox.</A> <H3>Setting Debeye-Waller Factors</H3>Debeye-Waller factors can be set. This can be accomplished by either manuallyinputing a value or double clicking on the Debye-Waller row of interest.Double clicking will bring up a <A HREF="DebyeTempCalc.html">Dialog Box</A>that helps calculate a Debye-Waller factor based on a stored Debye temperature,the atomic weight and the desired experimental temperature. <H3>Entering Meta-data or Bibliographic data</H3>To add this data, click on the<B> Ref button</B>. It will bring up the <A HREF="ReferenceDialogBox.html">BibliographicData Dialog Box</A><BR>Each of the fields is self explanatory. The only limitations are that theyear, the file number and the card number must be numeric. Otherwise, althoughit is encouraged to use the fields as specified, any data desired may bestored there.<BR><BR>For purposes of this tutorial, enter Titanium Aluminide &lt;tab&gt; 1939&lt;tab&gt; Al3Ti &lt;tab&gt; Zeitschrift Fuer Anorganische Und AllgemeineChemie &lt;tab&gt; 242/1 &lt;tab&gt; Brauer &lt;tab&gt; 1 &lt;tab&gt; 1.<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image11.gif" WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="197"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><H3>Bibliographic Data Dialog Box</H3>Desktop Microscopist is limited in its storage capability of bibliographicdata. It is recognized that as programs become increasingly more rich withrespect to capabilities and level of interactivity, it will become increasinglymore important to allow methodology for accurate flagging of different butsimilar results. This flagging should include original sources, potentiallyexperimental technique etc. <BR>After setting the bibliographic data, click on the <B>Reset Info </B>buttonto return to the main dialog box. <H3>Printing Unit Cell Data</H3>To obtain a printout of the crystal information, go to the <B>File pop-upmenu</B> and select <B>Print</B>. Follow the standard Macintosh procedurefor obtaining a printout of the crystal. This pop-up menu may also be usedto save the crystal in Desktop Microscopist or Diffract formats and opena new crystal in either Desktop Microscopist or Diffract formats. To savethe currently defined crystal in different format, select the Save As optionand a hierarchical menu will appear. Choose the desired file format specification.If the crystal is saved in an older Diffract format, all Meta-data, spacegroup information and Wyckoff (Point Set) positions will be lost! Save thecrystal now. <H3>Load And Dumping Crystal Data:</H3>The two remaining buttons, Load and Dump, are concerned with Desktop Microscopist'smethods for allowing transfer of pertinent data between windows and crystalobjects. This subject is also covered in further detail in the section on<A HREF="../Tutorial/CrystalLoadDumpTut.html">Load/Dumping</A> information.<H3>Defining A Precipitate Crystal</H3>The definition of the Al3Ti crystal is now complete. Click on the OK buttonto close the matrix definition box. As an exercise, go to the Ppt. #1 crystaldefinition dialog box and define the first precipitate type as aluminium.This crystal is cubic, has a lattice parameter of 4.048, space group isFm-3m (#225), with a Wyckoff Position of a4 (generating atom is positionedat the origin). Save and close the crystal dialog box. <H3>On To the Next Tutorial: <A HREF="../Tutorial/ORtutorial.html">DefiningOrientation Relationships</A></H3>At this point, the Al3Ti unit cell has been sufficiently defined to calculatediffraction patterns, plot stereographic projections etc. This definitionis sufficient for most purposes. For large unit cells in particular, furtherfunctionality may be realized with the use of space group designations.Utilization of the space groups to aid in the input of atomic positionsprovide a significant time savings and increased accuracy. <H3>Side Bar: <A HREF="Wyckoff.html">Using Space Groups and Wyckoff Generatorsto Input Atomic Positions</A></H3><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual<BR></A><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: VirtualLabs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
