Currenlty, Elastic Constants are used for the determinationof displacements about a dislocation line in the One and Two DislocationImaging Objects. The required values are exactly the same as described inthe book by <A HREF="../references.html">Humble and Head.</A> The ElasticConstant Dialog Box is accessed from the Parameter Menu from the hierarchicalmenu Elasticity Constants. <BR><BR>The elastic constant matrix is a 6x6 tensor which relates the strain ina material to the stress applied. It is based on linear elastic theory orHooke's law. The 6x6 tensor can be reduced to a 21 valued tensor when itis recognized that the tensor is symmetric around its principle diagonal,making all the bottom proportion dependent and therefore directly calculablefrom the upper values. More of these 21 values become dependent as the symmetryof the crystal is increased. An excellent discussion of these concepts isavailable in a book by <A HREF="../references.html">Nye</A>. The elasticconstants are given in MPa. The expected tensor gives the proper valuesfor the crystal with the &lt;001&gt; direction pointing out of the planeof the screen. The standard tensor is given in Cartesian coordinates. Theseare the expected values. For a given space group, Desktop Microscopist asksfor only the required independent constants. The remainder are calculatedfrom a knowledge of the dependencies. <BR><BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
