It is foundunder the Exp. Info Menu by selecting the Numerical Primitive Cell Calc.<BR><BR>The methodology for identifying a crystal based on experimental diffractioninformation is a major part of any general material science experiment withthe electron microscope.<BR><BR>Because of its importance, a number of schemes have been developed overthe years to aid this process. One method is the combined d-space informationand chemistry which was developed by M. Carr and co-workers during the compilationof the Electron Diffraction Database. This uses a set of d-space valueswith a fairly wide error range and the chemistry to very quickly narrowdown the potential crystals. An additional method, described by numerousauthors , , is the determination of the reduced cell volume for the experimentalcrystal. The reduced cell volume, combined with the chemistry of the unknownis an extremely powerful method which often can eliminate all but a singlecandidate. Desktop Microscopist supports the methodology described by LePageand Downham . The advantage of this technique is the ability to determinethe reduced cell volume from a single micrograph. It has a number of potentialpitfalls in its use. If this technique is unfamiliar, a review of the relevantarticles is encouraged.<BR><BR>In this technique, a diffraction pattern with both the zero order Laue zoneand one or more higher order zones is obtained. Measure two non parallelvectors from the zero order zone and the radii of as many higher order zonesas possible. Input these parameters into Desktop Microscopist and a reducedcell volume with periodicities can be calculated.<BR><BR>The following is a breakdown of each feature for this dialog box: .i.PCVNumerical Dialog:Set D-spacings;<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image161.gif" WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image162.gif" WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">These editable text boxes are used to enter the twonon co-linear plane d-spacings from the zero order zone. These d-spacingsmay be entered either in &Aring; or in mm.<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image163.gif" WIDTH="55" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Clicking on this button will cause it to toggle between&Aring; or mm. The label on this button expresses the units for the experimentald-spacings being entered. The mm selection should be used when enteringexperimental g-vectors as measured from a micrograph..i.PCV Numerical Dialog:D-spacingUnits;<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image164.gif" WIDTH="123" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This editable textbox which is found to the right ofthe d-spacing values is used to specify the camera constant for convertingthe experimental g-vector values to d-spacings..i.PCV Numerical Dialog:CameraConstant; <BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image165.gif" WIDTH="124" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This button is another toggling function. It changesfrom Camera Constant to Camera Length. This allows the alternative usageof a camera length for determining conversions.<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image166.gif" WIDTH="237" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This editable textbox is where the angle between thetwo zero order g-vectors is entered. The g-vectors must not be co-linearand as a result this angle may not be zero..i.PCV Numerical Dialog:Anglebetween;;<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image167.gif" WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This text box specifies the accelerating voltage tobe used for the calculations. This value is used for converting the cameralength to a camera constant and for the conversion of the radii to periodicities..i.PCVNumerical Dialog:Accelerating Voltage;<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image168.gif" WIDTH="124" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This second camera constant set of values is for theexperimentally determined radii of the higher order zones. Often, it isnecessary to measure the low order g-vectors lengths at a much higher magnificationthan the radii of the higher order zones. <BR>When opening this dialog box, Desktop Microscopist defaults the camera constantand accelerating voltage to the currently defined window values.<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image169.gif" WIDTH="74" HEIGHT="57" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> This editable text box and its associated check boxcheck are used to enter the expected zone order (Order - must be positiveinteger values) and the Diameter of the higher order Laue zones. <BR><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image170.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Clicking on this button or pressing return will initiatethe calculation. Desktop Microscopist will then place the calculated Periodicity(Period &Aring;) and the reduced cell volume (Vol. &Aring;3) in the appropriatecell.<BR>XII. Finally, Desktop Microscopist provides a means for comparing the calculatedvalues to the stored crystal values. <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image171.gif"WIDTH="78" HEIGHT="58" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Select the crystalfor comparison from this menu, enter the expected Zone Axis, and the desiredOrder for the calculation and Desktop Microscopist will return the calculatedPeriodicity, and the diameter in millimeters, based on the acceleratingvoltage and the second entered camera constant..i.PCV Numerical Dialog:ReferenceCrystal;<BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
