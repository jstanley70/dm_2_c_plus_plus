Desktop Microscopist now offers a selection of 7 differentmethods to achieve accurate orientation of the crystal. <UL>  <LI>(1)The user can orient the crystal with the beam parallel to a specifiedzone axis.   <LI>(2)Orient the Crystal with a Plane parallel to the computer screen.  <LI>(3-4) Orient the Crystal by rotating the crystal toward a given zoneaxis with the ability to specify perpendicular tilts off the <A HREF="../Tutorial/DesktopMicGlossary.html">tiltdirection</A>. The size of the rotation off of the tilt direction is specifiedin mm and corresponds to the amount the Kikuchi Band would be moved fromeither the <A HREF="../Tutorial/DesktopMicGlossary.html">Laue conditionor the Bragg condition </A>in a diffraction pattern taken with the currentbeam wavelength and camera length.<BR>(5-6) Orient the Crystal by rotating the crystal around a given g-vectorwith the ability to specify perpendicular tilts off the <A HREF="../Tutorial/DesktopMicGlossary.html">tiltdirection</A>.

The user must select a g-vector inthe plane of the screen. This g-vector rotated with respect to screen verticalwith positive rotation anti-clockwise is given in degrees.<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image142.gif" WIDTH="516" HEIGHT="298"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><B>Beam Orientation Dialog Box Set-Up For Down Zone Axis.</B><BR>(Note:  If the g-vector is not orhogonal to the Zone Axis, it is not usedto set rotation about the Zone)<BR><BR><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image143.gif" WIDTH="517" HEIGHT="300" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><B>Beam Orientation Dialog Box Set-Up For Rotation Towards A Pole</B></CENTER><P>Some users may prefer to set a particular off-axis orientation by consideringthe pole towards which they are rotating, since it is obvious the directionof rotation.<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image144.gif" WIDTH="517" HEIGHT="300"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><B>Beam Orientation Dialog Box Set-Up For Rotation Around A g-vector</B></CENTER><P>For rotations around a g-vector the rotation direction is determinedusing the right hand rule for positive rotations and the left hand rulefor negative rotations.<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image145.gif" WIDTH="517" HEIGHT="301"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><B>These Dialog Boxes Are Similar to The Laue Situation Only 0,0 is at Bragg.<BR></B><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image146.gif" WIDTH="517" HEIGHT="301" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>The Laue Circle Methodology uses the center of the laue circle as pointx,y.

The y axis is then determined by theright hand rule, x axis into the zone axis with the zone axis coming outof the screen.<BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
