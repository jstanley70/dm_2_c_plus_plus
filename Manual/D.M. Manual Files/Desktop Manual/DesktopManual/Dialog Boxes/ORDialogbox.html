It is accessed by selecting one of the three choices found under theParameter Menu Hierarchical menu item Define Orientations;. This dialogbox sets the orientation of each precipitate with respect to the matrixcrystal. Any number of O.R.s may be set for each precipitate crystal. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image6.gif" WIDTH="385" HEIGHT="175"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>Desktop Microscopist defines an orientation relationship as a set offour Miller indices, two indicators which determine whether each row ofMiller indices is either a plane or a direction and two rotation angles.<BR><BR>The four Miller indices are divided into two subsets of indices. Each subsetof two indices has one index from the matrix and one index from the respectiveprecipitate. These planes or poles are set parallel by Desktop Microscopist.Desktop Microscopist works by setting the first subset of either planesor directions parallel and then setting the second subset of planes or directionsparallel. The only requirement is that the angular relation between thematrix plane/direction subset is the same as the angular relation betweenthe precipitate plane/direction subset. <BR><BR>In some instances, two crystals have an orientation relationship that isnot easily described by rational poles. A typical example would be the relationshipbetween a martensite grain and the original matrix. Desktop Microscopistsupports one method for setting this type of relationship:<BR><BR>To set an irrational Orientation Relationship, first set the matrix/precipitateclosest to that desired. Next, two rotations about the defined matrix axesare allowed. The rotations occur in the order in which the relationshipwas defined. For example, if the orientation relationship is defined as:.i.IrrationalOrientation Rel.; <HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.amesT.
