Initially, a numberof elements may be highlighted. These highlighted elements correspond tothe elements which may be or must be present in the crystal chemistry. Tochange the default chemistry selection criteria, click on the desired criteriaand then either click on the desired element or click and move the mouseover the desired element. Elements which are selected for one criteria areautomatically removed from the other criteria. Re-selection will cause theelement to be de-selected from consideration.<H3><CENTER>Search / Match Dialog Box</CENTER></H3><B><I>PATH...{Diffraction Object}:Search/Match Menu:Search by d-space</I></B><BR>. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image136.gif" WIDTH="641" HEIGHT="482"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Search / Match Dialog Box</CENTER><P>The Dialog boxes for <B>Search by d-space</B>, <B>Search by g-Vecto</B>r;and <B>Search by Volume</B>; are essentially the same. The difference isthat if the Search by g-vector menu item is used to bring up the searchdialog box, the default values are for g-vectors; if the Search by Volume,then the default setting is for a search by crystal volume. Therefore, allthree search types will be discussed in this section.<BR><BR>The <B>Search Dialog Box </B>is very complex and contains a number of differentfunctions. <BR>It displays :<UL>  <LI>a list of the experimental d-spaces which are used during the search,  <LI>a list of the stored crystal d-space values and  <LI> an abbreviated plot of both the experimental and data base crystald-space values. </UL>This dialog also serves to access and display both shorthand and longhanddescriptions of any crystals found. Some simple editing of the databasecrystal is supplied. It is possible to Delete individual crystals from thecrystal list, to delete duplicates using the Doubles button and to saveonly Search Dialog Box:Selected Crystals; when closing the dialog box. Becauseof its complexity, the following is a step by step break down of each elementof the dialog box. It starts in the upper left and moves to the bottom right.<UL>  <LI>Use <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image137.gif" WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="37"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">to enter experimental d-spacings intothe Experiment list. </UL><B><I>Note: </I></B><I>The Experimental d-space list must be clicked onto activate this box.<BR></I><UL>  <LI>The <B>Search Dialog Box:Search Chemistry</B>; button brings up thepreviously described <A HREF="PeriodicTableDialog.html">Chemistry PeriodicTable</A>. This button eliminates the need to close the dialog box to setchemistry.  <LI>The Search by d-space pop-up menu sets both the type of search whichwill be conducted by Desktop Microscopist and how the results of that searchwill be displayed. There are six different possible selections:  <LI>Search by d-space. This is the most common search. The databases aresearched on the basis of planar d-space values. Experimental d-space valuesare compared with stored crystal d-space values. The window for matchinga d-space is fairly wide . Values in the the Experimental List are givenas d-space values, the scale is &Aring;. </UL><B><I>Note: I</I></B><I>f no values are entered into the d-space list, thesearch will be based solely on the selected chemistry. This is not an optionwhen search by volume has been selected </I><UL>  <LI><B>Search by g-vector</B>. The database search is based on distancesbetween points of maximum intensity as measured from the diffraction pattern.The distances are entered as measured (mm) and they are converted to &Aring;-1using the specified camera constant. Values in the Experimental List andthe Matched Crystal list are given as measured distances.  <LI><B>Search by 2 Theta</B>. The database is searched by 2-theta value.Where theta is the Bragg diffraction angle, theta is calculated for foundcrystals using the indicated wavelength value. The initial wavelength valuecorresponds to the value for the current window's acceleration voltage.  <LI>The final three menu items, <B>Volume Search/d-space, Volume Search/g-vector,and Volume Search/2 Theta</B>, search the database using the experimentallydetermined reduced volume as the selection criteria. However, the experimentalvalues and the crystal values are displayed as one of the three optionsdependent on the active menu item.  <LI>The <B>Total Matched </B>static text item provides a running totalof the crystals which have matched the search criteria. The maximum numberof crystals which Desktop Microscopist will display is 150. Therefore, ifthe total matched is greater than 150, the selection criteria needs to benarrowed.</UL><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image138.gif" WIDTH="268" HEIGHT="149"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Matched Crystal Info</CENTER><UL>  <LI>The above portion of the dialog gives a list of experimental d-spacings,the stored hkl values, intensity values and plane spacing values (d-space,g-vector, 2q). The Electron Diffraction Database seldom stores the hkl andintensity values. When that is the case the hkl values should default to100 and the intensity values to 0.  <LI>The Min. .FOM ; text box is used to set the Minimum Figure of Merit.The Figure of Merit is a weighted function dependent on the number of planevalues matched and the relative ranking of the matched plane. If no experimentald-space values are input, the FOM has no effect on the search. In generalthe higher the FOM the fewer the matches.  <LI><BR>  <LI>When searching dependent on crystal volume, the<B> Min. FOM text box</B>is converted to the <B>Exp. Vol. text box</B>. In this case, the reducedcell or cell volume in &Aring;3 which will be used for the database searchneeds to be input into this text box. When searching by volume, the crystalvolume in this box is always used as the criteria. Desktop Microscopistwill return any crystal meeting the set chemistry and whose volume or reducedvolume is within 15% of the search value. There is no method for controllingthe range of volume values.  <LI>The Save Selected Crystals; check box is used when leaving the Search/MatchDialog box to determine how to list the found crystals. When the check boxis selected then all crystals listed in the pop-up menu crystal list whichhave a mark will be added to the Search/Match Menu, all other crystals willbe eliminated. If the check box is not activated then all crystals in thepop-up menu crystal list will be added to the Search/Match menu.  <LI><BR>  <LI><BR>  <LI>Use the Search Location Popup menu to set the Database to be searchedby the program.  <LI>Use the <A HREF="Serach%20Dialog%20Box.html">Search Path;s function. </A>to help Desktop find the appropriate database.  <LI><BR>  <LI>The <B>Wavelength textbox</B> sets the wavelength used to calculatethe 2-theta values for the stored crystals. Its initial value correspondsto the current window's active beam's wavelength.  <LI>The <B>Camera Const.; (mm-&Aring;) textbox</B> sets the camera constantwhich is used to calculate the g-vector values for the stored crystal. Itsinitial value corresponds to the current window's active beam's Camera Constant.  <LI>The <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image139.gif" WIDTH="246" HEIGHT="33"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> pop-up menu is the crystal pop-up menuand provides a quick evaluation of the located crystals. The first valuegives the calculated Figure of Merit. The second is the reduced volume ofthe crystal in &Aring;3. The third and fourth values correspond to the spacegroup number and the space group symbol. The fifth and final value is thecrystal's empirical formula.  <LI>Clicking on the Delete button will delete the selected crystal.  <LI>Clicking on the <B>Doubles button</B> will delete all the duplicatecrystals in the crystal list. Crystals are considered duplicate if theyhave the same chemistry, same space group, and same crystal volume. Thecrystals are eliminated based on publication date. Therefore, when two crystalsare considered duplicate, the crystal with the most recent discovery dateis kept.  <LI>Clicking on the <B>Search button </B>activates the search algorithms.This process may be interrupted by pressing &lt;cmd-period&gt;. It is completewhen the watch cursor changes back to the standard arrow cursor.</UL><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image140.gif" WIDTH="349" HEIGHT="90"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>A display of pertinent crystal data.</CENTER><UL>  <LI>The <B>FOM textbox</B> lists the Figure of Merit for the current crystal.  <LI>The <B>Ref. button</B> brings up the <A HREF="ReferenceDialogBox.html">StandardReference Dialog box</A> which has been described previously under the crystaldefinition dialog box. It contains the reference data for the displayedcrystal.  <LI>The <B>Experiment / Database</B> display at the bottom of the dialogis a graphical display of the database crystal d-space values compared withthe experimental d-space values. The experimental values appear above thedividing line and database values below. The higher d-space values are plottedtowards the left of the line. Essentially, it is a g-vector display withthe left end of the dividing lines as the origin. </UL><BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
