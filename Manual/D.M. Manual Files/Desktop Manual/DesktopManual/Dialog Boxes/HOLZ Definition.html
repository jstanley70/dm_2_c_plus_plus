First determine the zone axis and then, if slightly offaxis, rotate the crystal by degrees using the Ir. Zone Axis Calculated:option. Determine the rotation of the crystal towards a given zone axis(down a specific g-vector) and then set the distance for the Laue or symmetricalposition in millimeters based on the camera constant..i.HOLZ Lines:SetupDialog:Ir. Zone Axis;<BR><BR>Use the lowest order and highest order editable text boxes to set the numberof Laue orders to calculate. Desktop Microscopist does not compensate forcrystals which have non-reflecting Laue zones. For certain crystals, ifonly the first order of HOLZ lines are specified, the results may not includeany lines whatsoever.<BR><BR>The .i.HOLZ Lines:Setup Dialog:2nd Calculation Method; option refers toan article by A. Eades which discusses the two methods for calculating HOLZline positions using a kinematic approximation. In this article, he suggeststhat the two methods be compared and the range of error between the twobe used as a guide to accuracy. Desktop Microscopist's default method isthe technique that Eades believes is more theoretically acceptable. By checkingthe 2nd Calculation Method, Desktop Microscopist will immediately repositionthe HOLZ lines based on the second approximation. <BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
