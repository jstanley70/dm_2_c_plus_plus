Any number of O.R.s may be set for each precipitatecrystal.  <LI>Desktop Microscopist defines an orientation relationship as a setof four Miller indices, two indicators which determine whether each rowof Miller indices is either a plane or a direction and two rotation angles..i.Orientation Relationship;.i.Define Orientations:Orientation Relationship;  <LI>The four Miller indices are divided into two subsets of indices. Eachsubset of two indices has one index from the matrix and one index from therespective precipitate. These planes or poles are set parallel by DesktopMicroscopist. Desktop Microscopist works by setting the first subset ofeither planes or directions parallel and then setting the second subsetof planes or directions parallel. The only requirement is that the angularrelation between the matrix plane/direction subset is the same as the angularrelation between the precipitate plane/direction subset.  <LI>In some instances, two crystals have an orientation relationship thatis not easily described by rational poles. A typical example would be therelationship between a martensite grain and the original matrix. DesktopMicroscopist supports one method for setting this type of relationship:  <LI>To set an irrational Orientation Relationship, first set the matrix/precipitate.i.Orientation Relationship:irrational; closest to that desired. Next, tworotations about the defined matrix axes are allowed. The rotations occurin the order in which the relationship was defined. For example, if theorientation relationship is defined as:.i.Irrational Orientation Rel.;</UL><BR><TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2" WIDTH="100%"> <TR><TH>Plane/Direction</TH><TH> Matrix</TH> <TH>Precipitate</TH> <TH>Rotation</TH> </TR> <TR> <TD>Plane</TD><TD>011</TD> <TD>0-11</TD> </TR> <TR><TD>Direction</TD> <TD>100</TD> <TD>011</TD></TR> <CAPTION ALIGN="Bottom">Sample Orientation Relationship</CAPTION></TABLE> <BR><BR>The crystals will be oriented so that the (001)matrix is parallel to the(011)ppt and the [001]matrix is parallel to the [011]ppt. The crystal willthen be rotated so that looking down the 001matrix g-vector the precipitatecrystal will be rotated 15&#176; in a clockwise direction and subsequentlylooking down the 010matrix g-vector the precipitate crystal will be rotated5&#176; in a counterclockwise direction.<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image87.gif" WIDTH="71" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This button is used to set the total number of orientationrelationships which are to be defined.

This button will cause Desktop Microscopist to attempt the determinationof all possible variants of the active orientation relationship. A variantof a crystallographic orientation can be defined as another orientationrelationship which will generate the exact same set of diffraction patternsas the original orientation relationship. However, when defined in tandemthese two or more relationships create a new set of diffraction patternswhich can be viewed as the sum of a set of the original diffraction patterns.<BR><BR>Variants are useful when looking at fine precipitates in a matrix whereit is difficult to achieve a single orientation relationship. The currentversion of Desktop Microscopist may not provide a complete answer. However,in most cases the variants will be correct and at the very least a reasonablesubset of the total possible variants will be provided..i.Define Orientations:Variants;<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual:</A><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A><BR><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: Virtual Labs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
