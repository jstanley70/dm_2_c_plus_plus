The following is a listof some and a display of other alert messages, their meanings and potentialcorrective action. <UL>  <LI><B>Copy Protection Alert </B><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image207.gif" WIDTH="371" HEIGHT="159" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Desktop Microscopist requires a hardware key which protects the softwarefrom unauthorized duplication. For this hardware key to work properly, thefollowing actionsmust occur.   <LI>The hardware key must be connected to one of the computer's ADB (mouse/keyboard)ports.  If,difficulties persist, please call Virtual Laboratories or see<A HREF="../Introduction/Installation.html">Installation</A>.<BR><BR></UL><H3><CENTER>Memory Errors </CENTER></H3><UL>Desktop Microscopist has a number of built-in methods for checking properhandling of memory during use of the program. If any of the following alertmessages appear, they indicate a potential memory problem. Frequently, theprogram will run with no further troubles. However, if possible, make anote of what activities preceded the appearance of the alert and the typeof alert which was activated and fax Virtual Laboratories with this information- it will help us to improve our product.   <UL>    <LI><B>Trying to Lock an Invalid Handle. </B>This message indicatesa serious problem. Shut down Desktop Microscopist and try to duplicate theoccurrence. Call Virtual Laboratories.     <LI><B>Trying to lock a Handle that is locked already. </B>Non-criticalerror. Note occurrence.     <LI><B>Attempt to lock Handle Failed. </B>Probably not critical. Noteoccurrence.     <LI><B>Trying to Unlock an Invalid Handle.</B> This message indicatesa serious problem. Shut down Desktop Microscopist and try to duplicate theoccurrence. Call Virtual Laboratories.     <LI><B>Handle is already Unlocked. </B>Not serious but note occurrence.    <LI><B>Handle Unlock failed. </B>May be critical, but probably not serious.Note occurrence.     <LI>The total number of Locks does not match the total number of unlocks.Not Critical, probably will not effect performance.     <LI><B>Trying to dispose of a Invalid Handle. </B>This message indicatesa serious problem. Shut down Desktop Microscopist and try to duplicate theoccurrence. Call Virtual Laboratories.     <LI><B>Trying to Dispose of a Locked Handle.</B> This message indicatesa serious problem. Shut down Desktop Microscopist and try to duplicate theoccurrence. Call Virtual Laboratories.     <LI><B>Trying to Dispose of an invalid Ptr.</B> This message indicatesa serious problem. Shut down Desktop Microscopist and try to duplicate theoccurrence. Call Virtual Laboratories.     <LI><B>Not enough room to allocate the new Ptr. </B>Indicates fragmentedmemory space. Close Desktop Microscopist and resume operations. Hopefully,Desktop Microscopist will close gracefully.     <LI><B>Not enough room to allocate the new Handle. </B>Indicates fragmentedmemory space. Close Desktop Microscopist and resume operations. Hopefully,Desktop Microscopist will close gracefully.     <LI><B>Not enough room to allocate the temporary Handle. </B>Indicationthat program is running out of room. Desktop Microscopist is designed totake advantage of available system memory. To free up blocks of new memory,close all open windows.     <LI><B>Object Allocation Failed. </B>Indicates lack of additional space.May indicate coding problems. Close open windows and try again.     <LI><B>Trying to dispose of an invalid class.</B> Indicates potentialproblem. Note occurrence.     <LI><B>Trying to dispose of a locked class. </B>Typically, not a seriouscoding problem. Note occurrence.     <LI><B>There are objects which have not been de-allocated.</B> Seenwhen quitting application. Indicates memory is not being de-allocated properly.Note occurrence and try to remember activities while in the program.     <LI> <B>Uh Oh....Some pointers were left hanging.</B> Seen when quittingapplication. Indicates memory is not being de-allocated properly. Note occurrenceand try to remember activities while in the program.     <LI><B>Trying to Re-size an invalid Ptr.</B> Serious problem. Typically,program will crash soon after activation of this alert. Note occurrence.    <LI><B>Trying to Re-Size an invalid handle.</B> Serious problem. Typically,program will crash soon after activation of this alert. Note occurrence.    <LI><B>JT_PopUp...Resource ID and Menu ID do not Match! </B>Will causeconfusion in execution of pop-up menu. Please note the object and dialogbox in use.     <LI><B>Uh Oh....While trying to condense a handle it was discoveredthat the condensed size would be BIGGER than the current size....Memorymay be trashed. </B>Confusion by programmers. Note occurrence. Call VirtualLaboratories.     <LI><B>Unable to down-size the handle...</B>This should never occur.    <LI><B>Trying to Down-size an invalid Handle.</B> This message indicatesa serious problem. Shut down Desktop Microscopist and try to duplicate theoccurrence. Call Virtual Laboratories.     <LI><B>Trying to allocate a zero length Handle. </B>Should never occur.Could be seen when opening a new object.
