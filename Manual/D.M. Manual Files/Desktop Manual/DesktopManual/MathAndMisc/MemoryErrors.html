This is not a programing error. Simplyclose any unnecessary windows and programs or reduce the size of the calculation.  <LI>An attempt to add O.R.s beyond the capacity of this program has occurred.The number of O.R.s is being set to the allowable maximum.  <LI>This operation is not valid for the matrix...  <LI>Out of Memory....Not enough memory is available to complete the calculation.Try closing open windows and other applications. Similar to the first MemoryAlert.  <LI>List Overflow. The specified parameters generated too much data fordisplay. The data has been truncated. Do not assume it is complete. </UL><H3><CENTER>Frame Grabber Errors;:.</CENTER></H3><BR>To use the Digitize Image... object, Desktop Microscopist requires a QuickCapture or compatible video board. <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image209.gif" WIDTH="362" HEIGHT="103"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> </CENTER><P><P><CENTER><B>Frame Grabber Board Error Alert Box</B></CENTER><P>The second alert concerned with the video imaging of the Digitize Imageobject is an indication that either the camera is turned off or an improperchannel has been selected.<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image210.gif" WIDTH="361" HEIGHT="118" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> <BR><P><CENTER><B>Frame Grabber Vertical Sync.

Thiscalculation could take a LONG time and use a LOT of memory....Would youlike to perhaps reconsider?</B>  <LI><B>Would you like to have the Picture fitted to fill the page? </B>Thisalert is seen when printing. It effects how Stereographic, objects derivedfrom Stereographic Projections and Real lattice images are printed. Useit to insure the maximum resolution.  <LI><B>Sorry, but there is a maximum capability of 26 different User definedfractional occupancy atoms. You are trying to exceed that limitation....Nocan do. T</B>his alert is seen in the Crystal Definition Dialog box andis self-explanatory. Desktop Microscopist allows a maximum of 26 User DefinedFractional Occupancy atoms.  <LI><B>Undefined Atoms: Cannot proceed. </B>Some entries have undefinedatomic numbers. This alert is seen when leaving the Crystal Definition DialogBox and it indicates that one of the atomic symbols cannot be interpretedby Desktop Microscopist. Check the symbols for any that are improper ormisspelled.  <LI> <B>Sorry.....But this program requires a Floating Point Co-Processor,a MC68881, MC68882, or a MC68040 CPU. </B>This alert is seen at start upto let the user know that the requisite hardware to run Desktop Microscopistis not available. See your Macintosh dealer to determine an upgrade path.  <LI><B> Refresh stack is corrupt. Inactive windows will no longer update.The program may crash.
