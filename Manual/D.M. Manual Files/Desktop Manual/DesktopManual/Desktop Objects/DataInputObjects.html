The crystal object will print its stored information,will export the definition to other crystals within the program and to apermanently stored file on an available disk drive. It also provides storagespace for elastic constants, crystal shape definition and it is equippedwith pointers for the storage of future information. Access this objectthrough the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/CrystalDefDialog.html">Unit CellDialog Box.</A> <H3>Elastic Constants:Object;</H3>The <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/ElasticConstantsDialog.html">Elastic ConstantObject</A> allows the definition of elastic constants for a given crystal..Elastic contants are used in the dislocation imaging object to determinelattice distortions caused by the insertion or deletion of an atomic plane.The elastic constant matrix is 6 x 6 and is symmetrical about the leadingdiagonal. Data input is necessary for only 21 of the possible 36 values.These values are also limited based on increasing symmetry of the crystal.This increased symmetry is supported by Desktop Microscopist. Elastic constantsare stored with the crystal. If elastic constants are entered, the crystalmust be saved to retain them. It is assumed that the elastic constant matrixhas been defined for the crystal in the standard orientation where (&lt;001&gt;)is coming out of the page. Access this object through the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/ElasticConstantsDialog.html">ElasticConstant Dialog Box</A> . <H3>Crystal Shape Object</H3>The crystal shape object allows the definition of the external morphologyof a crystal. The crystal shape is defined by a set of crystal faces andthe number of planes from the origin. As an example, it is possible to definea crystal which is an octahedron with &lt;111&gt; faces, etc. The crystalshape may be stored in a crystal shape library, which is a resource fileassociated with Desktop Microscopist. The crystal shape object will displaythe crystal morphology in the definition dialog box. Crystal shape informationis stored with the Crystal Object. Crystal shape information is used forcalculating streaking of SAD diffraction patterns and it is displayed whenusing the free rotate option in the Real Lattice Object. Within the reallattice object it is also possible to display and manipulate the Crystalshape instead of a lattice. Access this object through the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/CrystalShapeDialog.html">CrystalShape Dialog Box</A> . <H3><A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamOrientationDialog.html">Beam OrientationObject</A>:</H3>1. The <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamOrientationDialog.html">Beam OrientationObject</A> defines the orientation of a precipitate crystal with respectto the matrix crystal. It generates a transformation matrix. The objectallows an indefinite number of orientation relationships. Orientation relationshipsare determined by setting two coincident planes/directions from the matrixand the precipitate. It is also possible to create irrational relationshipsby rotating the precipitate with respect to the two defined matrix axes.Rotations are instituted in the order in which they are displayed. Thisobject will attempt to determine variants for a particular orientation relationship.It also stores the relative amount of the precipitate with respect to thematrix. This quantity is used in determination of diffraction intensityin SAD and derived objects. This object is only stored when saving a DesktopMicroscopist Object or derived file. It is possible to Load/Dump orientationsinto other portions of the current and default Desktop Microscopist Objects.<H3><A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamDefinitionDialogBox.html">Beam:Object</A></H3>There are three beam objects supported by Desktop Microscopist, an <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamDefinitionDialogBox.html">electronbeam</A>, a x-ray beam and an ion beam. Electron beam parameters which maybe input include: the accelerating voltage, the convergence angle, the cameralength or camera constant, the film response curve and the exposure time.The film response curve and the exposure time are used in diffraction calculationsto determine the size and intensity of calculated diffraction spots. The<A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/x-rayDefinitionDialogBox.html">x-ray beam</A>object supports the definition of a maximum energy, a characteristic x-raywavelength, convergence angle, camera length/camera constant, negative size,the film response curve, and the exposure time. There is a set of storedstandard characteristic x-ray wavelengths which are accessible from a pop-upmenu. Wavelengths include Cu,Cr,Co, Fe,Mo Ka and Kb lines... The <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Ion%20Definition%20DialogBox.html">ionbeam</A> stores the same information as the electron beam with the additionof the Ion type. The ion type is set by typing the standard symbol for agiven ion. These values will only be stored with a specific derived DesktopMicroscopist Object. <H3><A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Stage%20Control%20Dialog%20Box.html">StageObject</A>:Object</H3>The <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Stage%20Control%20Dialog%20Box.html">StageObject </A>is closely related to the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamOrientationDialog.html">BeamOrientation Object </A>in that it represents the physical manipulation ofa crystal using a one or two axis goniometer. In otherwords, rotating thestage object will alter the Beam orientation. However, to allow the beamobject and the stage object to be set independently, changing the orientationof the crystal in the Beam Object does not change the tilts in the stageobject. The stage object can find utility for a number of purposes. Theseinclude use with an Electron micrscope to determine necessary tilts to getto a Zone Axis of interest when working with a known crystal, determinationof a foil normal given the tilts of a know Zone Axis, determination of anunknow primitive lattice by the recording of two zone axis, determinationof the plane lattice for each zone and recording of the tilts between thesetwo zones, generation of pole figures from individual crystals, determinationof relative rotations between neighboring crystals etc. Currently, the StageObject supports either a single tilt or a double tilt holder. Where, inthe case of the double tiilt holder the second axis rotates with the firstor primiary tilt axis. This is the most common type of holder used in TEM.Access this object through the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Stage%20Control%20Dialog%20Box.html">StageObject Dialog Box.</A> <H3>Sample Object </H3>With the incorporation of the Dislocation imaging object, it has becomecritical to support a more accurate representation of the foil normal. Thus,it is now possible to fully determine the foil normal in the same fashionas the Beam Orientation. In addition, this object supports the value forthe absolute foil thickness, indicates the change in the projected foilthickness when the beam and the foil normal are not parallel, gives a comparisonwith the Extinction Distance for a selected beam and gives the angle betweenthe foil normal and the beam. Finally, if it is not critical to the problem,the foil normal can be set parallel to the beam and the only parameter neededattention will be the actual foil thickness. Access this object throughthe <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/SampleDialogBox.html">Sample Dialog Box.</A><H3>Atomic Scattering Factor:Object:</H3>1. This object is only accessible from the Atomic Data Presentation object.It allows the definition of new and the editing of old atomic scatteringcurves for x-rays and electrons. These curves are stored as resource filesin Desktop Microscopist. Scattering values are listed as a function of sin(q)/l(&Aring;-1). Actual scattering values are determined by linear extrapolationbetween the specific stored values. THE USER IS CAUTIONED TO MAKE A BACKUPCOPY OF DESKTOP MICROSCOPIST BEFORE USING THIS FUNCTION OR MAKING ANY CHANGES!This will ensure the ability to retrieve the standard set of atomic scatteringcurves. Virtual Laboratories supplies a limited set of atomic scatteringcurves. Use this object to define ionic scattering curves and any missingor conflicting neutral atoms.<BR><BR>The <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Atomic%20Info%20Dialog.html">Atomic ScatteringObject</A> is accessed via the <A HREF="../Menu%20Items/ParameterMenu.html">AtomicParameters... </A>menu item under the Edit menu. Double clicking on an elementin the resultant periodic table will bring up the data for that element.Click on the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Atomic%20Scattering%20Dialog.html">AtomicScattering Factor</A> button to view or modify the scattering factors. <H3>Contrast Transfer Function:</H3>Use this object to define the phase distortion of the objective lens asa function of the electrons radial position in the lens. Currently, it plotsthe CTF as a function of the radius given in reciprocal angstroms as a functionof the spherical aberration coefficient, the chromatic aberration coeffient,the accelerating voltage, the average fluctuation in the voltage and thecurrent. It will also plot the CTF as a function of angle given an astigmaticvariable. Finally, the CTF can be plotted as a function of defocus and beamdivergence. Numerical values which are calculated include the standard ScherzerDefocus , the Gausian defocus, the Point to Point Resolution, the informationlimit, the suggested optimum step for a through focus series and a set ofbroad contrast maximums with the center of the maximum peak.
