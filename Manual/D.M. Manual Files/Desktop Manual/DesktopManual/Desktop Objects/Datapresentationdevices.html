In general, these objects donot allow any importation or exportation of information. <H3>Search/Match:Object:</H3>Use the Search/Match object to query stored Desktop Microscopist files,the Electron Diffraction Database, the NBS Crystal Data File and the JCPDFPowder Diffraction File. The search match object supports searches by chemistry,by 2theta Bragg Angle, by g-vector and by crystal volume. <BR><BR>Found crystals are stored in a Crystal Object file and can be viewed byan alpha numeric display and by plotted d-spacing. The search/match objectwill plot a comparison of found d-spacings with experimental d-spacings.It is possible to insert the found crystals into the Desktop MicroscopistObject Crystal objects via the Search/Match Menu. To search these files,the crystals must be stored in appropriately identified folders. Separatedefault search paths are used for EDD files and for Desktop Microscopistfiles. To change the search path(s), access the Search Path's item underthe file menu. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Serach%20Dialog%20Box.html">Tofind out more about Search Paths.</A> <H3>Ruler Object:</H3>The first two objects which are described, the Ruler and the Ruler button,are used in all window objects as a quick reference for defined crystals,beam parameters and definitions related to the specific object. The Ruleralso supplies two display lines. The top line is used as a short descriptive.i.help line; while the bottom line displays specific information, suchas experimental d-space or angle between planes. When selecting a new function,the necessary information to proceed may be found by reading the help line.Look to the information line to describe the selected function and to returnany information which results from mouse interactions with the screen. <H3>Ruler Button:</H3>These objects appear as rectangular boxes on both table and window objects.They will have a one or two descriptive word such as: <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image31.gif"WIDTH="67" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">or <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image32.gif"WIDTH="67" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">.Clicking on thesebuttons will display a pop-up menu of the referenced information. Doubleclicking on these objects will bring up the pertinent definition dialogbox. For example, clicking on the button <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image33.gif"WIDTH="67" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">will show thelattice parameters, crystal volume and crystal density for the matrix crystal,while double clicking on this button will bring up the Matrix DefinitionDialog Box. <H3>Space Group:</H3>There are two methods of activating the space group object. The first isunder the Edit Menu. When Space Group Tables are selected, a menu bar witha list of the seven crystal families will appear. Selecting items underany of the menus will display the appropriate page of the Internationaltables for crystallography. This display is an abbreviated version of theInternational tables which concentrates on the Point sets for the activespace group. The headline approximates the headline from the Internationaltables and its description is best found in the International Tables vol.A. Both the Point Set or Wyckoff positions and the reflection conditionsare presented. These values are not editable.<BR>The second activation method is under the Crystal Definition Dialog boxwhile using the Wyckoff positions to define atomic positions. The spacegroup set is not visible from the dialog box. Use the space group identifiersto facilitate crystal definition. <H3>Atomic Info:Object:</H3>The Atomic Info Object allows the viewing of stored atomic information.This information includes name, symbol, atomic weight, atomic number, atomicradius for typical ionic, covalent, metallic and van der Waal states. Italso supplies nuclear information such as isotopes, isotope relative abundance,cross-sections and spins. Electronic information includes ground state electronicconfiguration, electronic affinity, the work function for the standard crystal,limited electrochemical information, electro-negativity, crystal structures,transition temperatures, melting and boiling points and density at standardtemperature and pressure. It additionally reports available orbitals andvalances. This object gives access to the Atomic Scattering Object whichprovides the capability to view and edit atomic electron and x-ray scatteringfactors.<BR>Access to the Atomic Info object is obtained from the Edit Menu under themenu item Atomic Parameters. <H3>Text Button:</H3>Desktop Microscopist supports a text object for labeling plots, etc. Itis activated from the Ruler Object by simply clicking on the button labeled:Text Off. This changes the button to read Text On. This enables the typingof text onto the plot in a fashion similar to that found in a drawing program.The text is stored as an object and can be subsequently edited and moved.The only restriction at this time is that the shape of the box cannot bealtered by the user. It is automatically sized to best fit the typed data.Press the &lt;return&gt; key for additional lines. Font type, font size,font effects, text color and text justification are selected by the pop-upmenu which is activated by clicking and holding the Text On/Text Off rulerbutton. <H3>Graph Object:</H3>The graph object has been extended in the new Desktop Microscopist 2.0.Its increased functionality, displaying a standard x-y linear graph withordinate and abscissa labeled and a single title. In addition, it now canbe found in the Monte Carlo and diffractometer segments. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image330.gif" WIDTH="283" HEIGHT="252"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Example of the Graph Object</CENTER><P><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image331.gif" WIDTH="66" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">It allows the user to import or export textdata.  Imported data must be in single column values with rows separatedby a return.  Exported data will be in a similar format.<BR>The <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image332.gif" WIDTH="46" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> menu allows the user to <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/SpectrumPlotSetup.html">changegraph color</A>, hide spectra, delete spectra and do <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/SpectrumMath.html">somesimple spectra math</A>.<BR><BR>The <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image333.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> box will shrink the graph to an icon.<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image334.gif" WIDTH="43" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> Double clicking on the icon will bring the graph back.

Clicking in the graph willcause the plot to expand around the point.  <I>-shift-</I>click  on thegraph will cause it to return to the original settings.<BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image337.gif" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> Clicking in this symbol allows the user to shrink orgrow the graph box.<BR><H3><BR>Text Box Object:</H3>The textbox is a fully functional spread sheet like object which allowsdisplay of numerical data for a particular object. It supports cut/copyand paste of text. It allows export and import of numerical data in asciiformat. It can be moved, iconized and reshaped. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image294.gif" WIDTH="343" HEIGHT="327"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><B>Example of the Text Object.</B></CENTER><H3>Work Environment:</H3>This section describes general features and functions available with DesktopMicroscopist. It starts with a description of how to control the work environmentwith such things as color control, window sizing, scrolling, and settingmagnifications. It continues with a reiteration of the Default concept andmethods to set defaults and finishes with a discussion of cut and pasteoperations, printing and file manipulation.<BR><HR><I>Author:James T.
