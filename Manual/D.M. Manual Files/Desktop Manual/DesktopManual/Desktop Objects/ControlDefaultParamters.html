Theprogram allows different data sets to be displayed, while providing a straightforwardmechanism for the transfer of data from window to window. This is accomplishedthrough the use of Default information. The primary information necessaryto run a particular object is stored in a Default file. This file is transferredto each new window or table as it is opened. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image36.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="190"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><H3><CENTER><A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Load%2FdumpCrystalAlert.html">Load/ Dump Dialog Box</A></CENTER></H3>There are three methods for setting and retrieving Default information.<UL>  <LI>The first method is the defining of the primary parameter set of fourcrystals, three orientation relationship sets, four crystal elastic constants,four crystal shapes, electron beam parameters and a default x-ray beam.This is done by defining the parameter set <B>before any object windowsare open.</B><BR><BR><BR>  <LI>The second method for defining default parameters is the use of theDump options.   <UL>    <LI>The Dump options are accessed in the definition <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/CrystalDefDialog.html">dialogboxes of the crystal</A>, <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/PPtInfoDialogBox.html">orientationrelationship</A> and <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamDefinitionDialogBox.html">beamdefinitions</A>. Clicking on this button brings up a dialog box which allowsthe current crystallographic information to be &quot;Dumped&quot; or passedinto either the Default or the local window crystal definitions. <BR><BR>  </UL>  <LI>The third method for setting Default parameters is the &lt;<A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Default-%3EPreferenceDialog.html">Default&lt;-Current</A>&gt; button found in the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Default-%3EPreferenceDialog.html">Default&lt;-&gt;CurrentDialog Box</A> Clicking on this button changes the default settings to thoseof the current object.   <UL><BR>  </UL>  <LI>There are three complimentary methods for setting the local parametersto the default set. The first is simply to open a new window of the desiredobject. The second is to click on the <B>Load </B>button. This brings upthe same dialog box as the <B>Dump</B> option, but in this instance theselected values are inserted into the current dialog box information. Thethird method is to use the &lt;<B><A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Default-%3EPreferenceDialog.html">Default-&gt;Current</A></B>&gt;button, this resets the current window information to the Default information.</UL><BR><I>Note: The &lt;<B><A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Default-%3EPreferenceDialog.html">Default-&gt;Current</A></B>&gt;button and the &lt;<A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Default-%3EPreferenceDialog.html">Default&lt;-Current</A>&gt; button are mutually exclusive. This is because selectingone of buttons replaces the information needed to utilize the other. Ifthe defaults values are set to the current values, selecting Revert to Previousdoes nothing, as the current and default values are equivalent.</I> <H3>Preference File; Storing Initial Set-Up Information:<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image52.gif"WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H3>New with version 2.0, Desktop Microscopist allows the user to save a currentset-up into a preference file. This set-up includes Search Paths, all crystaldata, oreintations, orientation relationships, Picture Transfer Modes, BeamDefinitions, spot shape preferences, structure factor set-ups, and any additionsor changes to the Atomic Scattering and Crystal Shape libraries. This abilitymeans that it is easy to start up from where the user last left off andmore importantly, upgrading will no longer require resetting the SearchPaths and reinputting any Atomic Scattering or Crystal Shapes.<BR><BR>The Preference file is created when the program is first launched. The preferencefile is stored in the <B>System Folder's Preferences Folder </B>in a filecalled <B>Desktop Micrsocopist Prefs</B>. The preference file is automaticallyupdated whenever the Search Paths, Atomic Scattering or Crystal Shape librariesare altered. However, changes to the Default parameters must be activelyinserted into the preference file. To update a the preference file to thecurrent <I>Default</I> setting go the the menu item:<A HREF="../Menu%20Items/ParameterMenu.html">SetDefault&lt;-&gt;Local. </A>found under the Parameter Menu, brings up the<A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Default-%3EPreferenceDialog.html">Default&lt;-&gt;CurrentDialog Box</A> .<H3>Linking:<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image53.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H3>A new feature with Desktop Microscopist 2.0, is the ability to link windows.When windows are linked they maintain the same crystals, the same orientationrelationships, the same stage orientation, and the same beam orientation.This allows the user to quickly update various representations of the experimentalsituation efficiently, and to gain some insight into the relationship betweenreciprocal space and the corresponding real space representation. Linkingcan be either dynamic or static. If, dynamic linking is active, all linkedwindows are immediately updated when any of the linked objects are alteredwith respect to crystal definition, orientation relationship, stage orientationor beam orientation. If, static linking is active, the window is updatedwhen it is brought to the forefront with respect to the accumulated changessince it was last updated. Selection of the linking method is most commonlydetermined by processor speed. All windows which are opened after the Linkingflag is set in the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Misc.%20Parameters%20Dialog.html">SetMisc. Parameters </A>dialog box are Linked. Those windows opened beforelinking was activated will remain static windows. Linking is found by goingto the <A HREF="../Menu%20Items/ParameterMenu.html">Set Misc. Parameters</A>:menu item found under the Parameter Menu. <BR><BR>See <A HREF="../MathAndMisc/Keyboard%20Equivalents.html">Overbars or NegativeMiller Indices:</A> <H3>Printing:<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image51.gif" WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="12"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H3>Printing in Desktop Microscopist is not a typical &quot;What You See IsWhat You Get&quot; (WYSIWYG) Macintosh interface. This is particularly trueof the table information which is formatted to utilize the full print page.Plots and graphs may be labeled through the use of the Text. Crystal summariescan be printed, however there are no other methods for obtaining a printoutof crystallographic data that has been input, or of the stored information.Printing is via the standard methodology of selecting <A HREF="../Menu%20Items/BaseMenus1.html">Print</A>under the File Menu.<BR><BR>File input and output is standard. Crystal files can be opened from theFile Menu. However, when opened from the File Menu, the crystal informationis inserted into the the currently active window's Matrix Crystal. If nowindows are open, the crystal information is inserted into the Default MatrixCrystal object. The only other file type which can be accessed from theFile Menu is a Desktop Microscopist File. These files store Desktop Microscopistobjects. When such a file is opened the data is automatically inserted intoan appropriate Desktop Microscopist object and the correct window or tableis opened. Double clicking on either file type will launch Desktop Microscopist.<BR>PICT ;files can be opened in SAD and derived objects. Importation of a PICTfile is accomplished by selecting the <B>Place... </B>option under the <B>FileMenu</B>. The picture is automatically placed by Desktop Microscopist andcan subsequently be moved to the desired position.<BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author:<A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.
