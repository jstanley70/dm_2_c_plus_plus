It starts with a description of how to control the work environmentwith such things as color control, window sizing, scrolling, and settingmagnifications. It continues with a reiteration of the Default concept andmethods to set defaults and finishes with a discussion of cut and pasteoperations, printing and file manipulation. <H3>Controlling the Work Environment:</H3><H2>Color and Contrast:</H2>Desktop Microscopist supports color, grey scale and monochrome displays.Monochrome displays have their particular limitations and are discussedin a following section.<BR><BR>Desktop Microscopist uses color to help differentiate crystals from oneanother, to identify atomic elements in the real lattice object, to colorthe lettering in the table objects and to set the background color for windowand table objects. Grey scale coloration is typically used to denote relativeintensity of calculated diffraction spots or diffraction lines. When usedin this capacity the object is best viewed with a black background. Thegrey scale option is specifically requested in the active window. Typically,this option is activated using the object's definition window (See the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/SAD.Laue.Etc.Setup%20Dialog.html">DefineDialog Box</A> for the SAD Object). There is no control over the grey scaleLook Up Table (LUT) and a default linear grey scale LUT is used. <H2>Color:Displays;</H2>Color is set for both the background and crystals themselves by using thestandard Apple Color wheel. To access the color wheel for the background,go to the Set Background Color menu item under the Edit Menu. This actionwill bring up the color wheel. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image34.gif" WIDTH="352" HEIGHT="247"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Color Selection Dialog Box</CENTER><P>The colors may be set with a combination of scroll bar and mouse or byinputting the desired RGB (red, green, blue) or HSB (Hue, saturation, brightness)values. The new background color will immediately be implemented in thecurrent object. To set the crystal color, it is necessary to go to the specificcrystal definition dialog box and click on the button labeled color. Thecolor wheel dialog box will again appear and the crystal color may be reset.<BR><BR>Setting the color of elements in the Real Lattice object is more narrowlydefined. This is a result of the need to support rendering or three dimensionalcues in a real lattice plot. Therefore, it is required that a <I>set</I>of colors be selected for each element. To set a color, double click onan atom of the given element type. This accesses the color dialog box. DesktopMicroscopist supports: Red, Cyan, Green, Blue, Magenta, Yellow and Orange.<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image35.gif" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="212"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><H3><CENTER>Atom Color Dialog Box</CENTER></H3><H3><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The Different Transfer Modes:</H3>Desktop Microscopist supports the use of experimental patterns for comparisonand data analysis. Therefore, it is critical to support various methodsfor displaying the simulated pattern, with the experimental pattern withthe chosen background and tool in use. Apple Computer supplies built inmethods for handling the display of different overlaid elements. These arecalled transfer modes.<BR>Desktop Microscopist has a set of four built in transfer modes which canbe activated by selecting the mode of interest from the <A HREF="../Menu%20Items/BaseMenus1.html">EditMenu:Transfer Mode</A>.<H3>Monochrome Displays:</H3>Desktop Microscopist was designed for a color environment, but will supporta black and white environment. When using grey scales in a monochrome environment,Desktop Microscopist attempts to simulate grey scale coloring by substitutingan 8 pattern approximation to grey scale. In the real lattice portion, whenin a render mode, Desktop Microscopist uses these 8 patterns to try andaid depth cues. When in the non-render default mode, Desktop Microscopistuses a set of patterns which have been stored for each individual elementtype. These patterns are not directly editable but can be accessed usinga program such as ResEdit (distributed by Apple Computer). <BR><BR><B>Important</B>: In standard plotting mode under the monochrome option,it is imperative that the color wheels for each crystal are set to contrastwith the background color. If this is not done and there is not sufficientcontrast between the crystal color and the background color, nothing willbe seen. This can be particularly disconcerting when the calculation resultsin a blank screen in a window object or an empty list in table object! <H3>Window Control:</H3>Window objects may be re-sized, scrolled and moved as typical Macintoshwindows. For objects such as stereographic projections, Diffractometer andReal lattice where the scaling is not critical for an understanding of theinformation, there is a Redraw option under the Function or Define menuwhich will automatically scale and center the plot in the re-sized window.Table objects are restricted to a set size and access to the complete listis accomplished by the use of a standard Macintosh scroll bar. <H3>Magnification:</H3><UL>  <LI>Depending on the object, Desktop Microscopist allows determinationof the size of the plot or graph. As detailed in the above section on windowcontrol, in objects such as the stereographic projection the size of thewindow may be used to determine the size of the graph. Another feature ofthe stereogram, the Kikuchi map and the Kossel map is the ability to Zoomin around a particular region of the plot. Zooming is accomplished by selectingthe Zoom In item under the Rotation Menu. The .i.Zoom ;cursor is then activated.Clicking the mouse at the point of interest activates the zoom box. Then,while holding the mouse down, drag the mouse, pulling a box around the regionto be enlarged. Alternatively, clicking at the point of interest will causethe view to be expanded to twice its original size. The stereogram or Kikuchimap is not automatically rotated and centered around the selected point.  <LI>In the <B>Real Lattice object,</B> crystal size is controlled in severalways: by a scaling factor, Zoom In which zooms the picture by 2x, Zoom Outwhich zooms the picture by .5x and an automatic zoom feature which fitsthe lattice picture to the size of the current window.   <LI>For objects which depend on a specific conversion factor such as SADor the Debye-Scherrer program, there are two ways to set magnification ofthe plot:   <LI>The first is by setting the camera constant for the figure. The cameraconstant or camera length is found in the Beam Object Dialog Box. This figureis exactly the same as the camera constant determined experimentally fora specific instrument.   <LI>The second technique sets a screen magnification by specifying a distanceon the screen and then converting this to an equivalent distance on a diffractionpattern. This option is accessed by using &lt;option&gt; m when using eitherthe menu items <A HREF="../Menu%20Items/SADMenuItems.html">Set Magnification(Ring M) and Set Magnification (Line Method</A>). This action brings upthe <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Set%20MagnificationSAD.html">Magnificationdialog box</A>. The magnification is set automatically by inserting theactual distance which corresponds to the distance specified on the screen.</UL><H3>Plotting; (labeling type and spot shape):</H3>Control of the spots to be plotted is done from the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/PlotParametersDialog.html">SetPlot Parameter dialog bo</A>x. This dialog box allows plane and directionspot types (square, filled square, diamonds, circles, default type filledcircles, crosses, x's and plus signs) to be set independently for each crystal.This feature is useful when printing patterns and when using a monochromemonitor. Upon setting the plot parameters, the automatic re-plot will causethe patterns to change for the individual crystal spots. The change is automaticand immediate. This is a universal feature and not specific to an individualwindow..<H3>Hexagonal Indices:</H3>Desktop Microscopist supports three and four index hexagonal labels. Thisoption is accessed through the<A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Misc.%20Parameters%20Dialog.html">Set Misc. Parameters Dialog Box</A>. This is a universal feature and notspecific to an individual window. It is also immediate and automatic onre-plot. <H3>Cutting and Pasting:</H3>Limited cutting and pasting is supported by Desktop Microscopist. Plotsare cut as bit maps and may be pasted into any program which supports bitmaps. Desktop Microscopist also supports multiple cutting and pasting withinthe program. As an example, it is possible to cut an 001 zone axis diffractionpattern, a 110 zone axis diffraction pattern and to paste it into a stereographicprojection. Pictures may be deleted and moved on an individual or jointmethod. To move a single picture, simply click the mouse and drag the picture.Where two pictures overlap, the top one will be selected. Deletion of apicture can be accomplished by using the Clear option under the Edit Menuor by pressing the &lt;delete&gt; key. <H3><A HREF="ControlDefaultParamters.html">Defaults: Data Transfer BetweenWindows:</A></H3>Desktop Microscopist enables the user to make slight variations of basicparameters to more effectively compare with experimental information. Theprogram allows different data sets to be displayed, while providing a straightforwardmechanism for the transfer of data from window to window. This is accomplishedthrough the use of Default information. The primary information necessaryto run a particular object is stored in a Default file. This file is transferredto each new window or table as it is opened.  To Transfer information intothe Default File, Use the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Default-%3EPreferenceDialog.html">Default&lt;-&gt;CurrentDialog Box .</A><BR><HR><I>Author:James T.
