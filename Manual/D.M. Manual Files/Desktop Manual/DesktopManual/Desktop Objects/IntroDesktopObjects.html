The firsttype of object is actually a collection of objects which support a particularplotting feature such as a stereographic projection. All objects of thistype in Desktop Microscopist are derived from the Desktop Microscopist orDiffract Object. The second type of object is a data type object. A typicaldata type object supports data retrieval, data input and potentially datapresentation. One example of this type of object would be the crystal objectwhich supports crystal definition, another example would be the CrystalButton which supports crystal presentation in a pop-up menu.<BR><BR>The first part of this chapter describes the Desktop Microscopist and derivedobjects. The second part describes the more important data presentationand data definition objects. The final portion of this chapter deals withsome important general concepts needed to effectively use Desktop Microscopist.These subjects include, <A HREF="Datapresentationdevices.html">cutting andpasting, printing of information, storage and retrieval, the use of defaultsto transfer information, and controlling the work environment (setting backgroundcolor, crystal color, label type, etc.) and search/match capabilities.</A><BR><BR>Each object in turn may have a set of objects which are derived from it.The advantage of the derivation of objects from a single source is in theinheritance of capabilities from original to derived object. The abilityto define unit cells and orientation relationships is passed automaticallyto all objects derived from the Desktop Microscopist Object. The followingis a graphical representation of the derivation or inheritance of capabilitiesfor each of these objects, as well as a symbolic representation of differentdata groups which are accessible to various objects in Desktop Microscopist.As an example, the space group data types and the atomic information datatypes are available to the root object. However, the EDD database is onlyaccessible from the SAD object and its derived objects. 8-bit real time(CCD Camera) information can only be accessed through the Image acquisitionobject and requires a Quick Capture card (or equivalent). Arrows indicatedata exchange within the program..i.EDD:Database; <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image26.gif" WIDTH="396" HEIGHT="311"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image27.gif" WIDTH="279" HEIGHT="124" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><H2><CENTER>List of Desktop Microscopist and Derived Objects</CENTER></H2><H3>Diffract/Desktop Microscopist Object:</H3>This object is used as the default object and the preference file object.It allows access to all defined derived objects and the following data objects:Crystal, Orientation Relationship, Atomic Information, Space Group information,Crystal Shape, Crystal Elastic Constants, Beam Definition, Stage ControlObject and Beam Orientation. <H2>Table Objects:</H2>The Table Object is never directly accessible. It is a template for thed-space, angle between directions, angle between plane, periodicity anduseful info objects. It supports numerical lists. <H3>Angle Between Planes:</H3>Use this object to determine a set of planes which meet the following criteria.d-space for both planes and angle between planes. A range of d-space andangle values may be specified. It is also possible to calculate angles betweenpoles of the primary defined crystals. It is possible to search the matrixcrystal for one set of planes and to compare this set of planes with a setof planes from the first precipitate crystal. Desktop Microscopist returnsthe zone axis, the found planes, their respective d-spacings and the anglebetween the planes. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Plane%20Angles%20Dialog.html">AngleBetween Planes Dialog Box</A>. <H3>Angle Between Directions:</H3>This object calculates the angle between a given direction and a set ofdirections. Directions which fall within a set angular range are listed.The set of directions includes all directions designated between the maximumMiller index. It is possible to compare direction angles between a matrixand one of the precipitate crystals. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Direction%20Angles%20Dialog.html">AngleBetween Directions Dialog Box</A> <H3>d-space Object:</H3>This object will calculate a list of d-spaces for any of the four primarydefined crystals. Results may be sorted by d-spacing, structure factor orextinction distance. D-spacings are listed for planes with d-spacings greaterthan the specified minimum value. Results may be displayed in &Aring;,&Aring;-1,degrees and mm. These units correspond to d-spacings, reciprocal d-spacings,Two theta angle and g-vector. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/TableAndDspaceDialog.html">D-spaceDialog Box Setup.</A> <H3>Periodicity:</H3>For purposes of this program, the periodicity of a zone axis is the distancebetween the first and zero order Laue zones. Desktop Microscopist calculatesthe periodicity for a set of zone axes, lists the zone axes, the periodicityand the radius of the first order Laue zone. The radius of the first orderLaue zone is a function of the radius of the Ewald sphere (1/wavelength)and the periodicity. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Periodicity%20Dialog.html">PeriodicitySetup Dialog Box.</A> <H3>Useful Info:</H3>Useful Info is a calculator for specific planes. It returns the followinginformation for two given planes: d-spacing, complex structure factor infour different format and with or without Debye-Waller factor, extinctiondistances, Angle between planes, plane normal direction, and the zone axis.Planes may be from any of the four primary crystals, independent of theother plane crystal. If two different crystals are used, the calculatedzone axis is for the matrix crystal. This information may be exported toan ASCII tab delimited file. <BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Useful%20Information.html"><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image342.gif" WIDTH="365" HEIGHT="383" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER><H3>Experimental 2-D Lattice:</H3>This object is completely generated from experimental data generated fromthe SAD and derived objects.
