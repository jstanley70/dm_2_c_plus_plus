It adds supportfor graph windows, scrolling, re-sizing, the ruler and the ruler buttonsat the top of the window of the Desktop Microscopist Object. <H2>Stereographic Projection:Object;</H2>The stereographic projection object plots a stereographic projection inan expandable, scrollable, fully Macintosh compatible window. It supportsstereograms of all four primary crystals for both direction and plane polestereograms. This object supports zooming, an additional seven types ofrotation (to vertical, to horizontal, to center, about center, <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">about the x-axis,<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> about the y-axis, and <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">about a selected pole axis), spot addition by both index and angularmethods. In addition, Stereographic projections can be oriented using eitherthe Stage Object or the Beam Orientation object. Defect analysis is availablethrough a special dialog box which allows specific orientation of the stereogramto align the projection in congruence with an experimental micrograph. Itallows irrational plane and direction determination from cursor positions,habit plane selection and the ability to selectively rotate specific poles.In addition, plots of small and great circles are easily added. A planestereogram with spot size and grey scale intensity based on the relativestrength of the calculated structure factor for the strongest pole coincidentat that location may be generated. Other features include labelling of spots,<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">generation of spots by symmetry operation and <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> the display of all poles, forward and reverse projected. <BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">New with version 2.0 , it is possible to input experimentalcrystal orientations to calculate pole figures, or to determine crystalorientations between two selected experimental orientations. Inputting ofthe experimental crystal orientations can be either manually or by usingthe SAD and related objects to set an experimental pole. <H3>Kikuchi Map:Object</H3>A derivative of the Stereogram Object, the Kikuchi Map plots an approximationto an actual Kikuchi Map. Kikuchi lines are calculated and plotted basedon the relative intensity of their structure factors. Grey scale representationof intensity is an option. The Kikuchi Map maintains most of the functionalityof the Stereographic Projection, however many of the analytical functionshave been eliminated. It should be noted that the plot time for a KikuchiMap may be significant. Kikuchi band width is calculated on the basis ofd-spacings. <I>Finally, the Kikuchi model is a stereographic projectionand not a goniometric projection</I>. This point is important for any analyticalwork but is unimportant for the current K-maps intended purpose. K-linescan be labeled and the major zone axis locations are designated by directionpoles. <H3>Kossel Map:Object</H3>The Kossel Map object is similar to the Kikuchi pattern object and has essentiallythe same functionality. However, the Kossel and the BEKP objects use thecorrect geometry for for the plotting of Kossel lines. As a result, thecamera length / camera constant determine the spacing of the Kossel lines.The lines that are generated are true conic sections projected onto a planelocated one camera length away from the origin. The zone axes are set usinga gnomonic projection. Use the beam definition dialog box to set the cameralength.<BR><BR><I>Note: The Zoom function has the effect of changing the camera constant...useit with care.</I> <H3>SAD:Object</H3>The SAD Object adds a great deal of functionality to the program. The SADobject supports PICT files, allows search and match for crystal structuresbased on d-space, g-vector, volume and chemistry. It will plot a diffractionpattern for a specific set of crystal orientation relationships. Diffractionpattern calculations are based on crystal thickness, foil normal, and beamparameters. It allows the experimental determination of d-spacings, zoneaxis, angle between points on a micrograph, reduced cell volumes, and experimentalperiodicities. In addition to setting camera length, magnification may alsobe set. Diffraction patterns can be labeled, diffraction points can be queriedwith respect to d-space, structure factor and extinction distance. Doublediffraction may be simulated. Diffraction spots are plotted based on relativeintensity and can be plotted proportional to size and with respect to a256 grey scale. Addition of spots may be by additive or by free techniques.Spots may be moved freely and may be subtracted from the pattern. <BR><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">With version 2.0, there are added tools which allowthe determination of a two dimensional diffraction grid from an experimentalpattern. This experimental grid can be tablulated and displayed as a. table.<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Using the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Stage%20Control%20Dialog%20Box.html">StageObject</A> to set the beam orientation and collection of two or more experimentaldiffraction gratings it is now possible to <A HREF="../How%20To/generate3dlattice.html">calcluatethe probable primitive cell lattice</A> for any unknown crystal.   <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/SAD.Laue.Etc.Setup%20Dialog.html">SADObject Dialog Box.</A><BR>Streaking effects caused by precipitate shapes can now be calculated usingDesktop Microscopist.

The HOLZ lines may be labeled individually and relativeintensity may be represented by grey scale. This is a kinematic approximation.The ability to plot the HOLZ pattern with curved lines is provided, twodifferent methods for approximating HOLZ line position are utilized. HOLZplots are calculated for one crystal at a time.  <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/HOLZ%20Definition.html">HOLZDefinition Dialog Box.</A><H3>Laue:Back Reflection:Object</H3>The Laue Back Reflection Object simulates the single crystal diffractionpattern obtained by back reflection x-ray techniques. It assumes a monotonicallydecreasing intensity as a function of maximum energy with a spike at thecharacteristic x-ray peak. An experimental Laue Diffraction Pattern is acomplex function of the accelerating voltage, the target material and thetarget specimen interaction. (The current Laue Back reflection object isa reasonable first approximation but should be handled with care.) <H3>Laue:Transmission:Object</H3>This object simulates the Laue Transmission Diffraction Pattern. It is essentiallythe same object as the Laue Back Reflection except the diffraction geometryhas been corrected to approximate the forward scattering phenomena. <H3>Diffractometer</H3>This is the first object to plot information using a standard polycrystallinetechnique. The Diffractometer will plot a graph of intensity vs 2q for eachcrystal. Calculations of intensity are based on a consideration of multipleor weighted scattering from each pole and the use of a standard Lorentz-polarizationfactor as given in Cullity. 2q and d-spacing values can be read directlyfrom the plot; labeling of individual peaks is supported. The calculateddiffractometer pattern is plotted in a graph object, which allows importingof tab delimited ascii intensity plots. In addition, it supports some spectramathematics. Finally, the first attempts at a full simulation of a diffractometerplot has been incorporated into the program. This simulation broadens thepeaks based on instrumental parameters (slot size and step size) and theeffect of average crystal size. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/DiffractometerDef.html"> Definition Dialog Box.</A><H3>Ring Patterns;</H3>The electron ring pattern program calculates a ring pattern for a specificcrystal or set of crystals. This program is used primarily to compare diffractionpatterns taken from a poly-crystalline sample which approximates a largedistribution of oriented crystals. Rings may be individually labeled andintensities represented in grey scale fashion. Rings can either be fullyor partially plotted.   <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Ring.DebyeShereDef.html">DefinitionDialog Box.</A><H3>Debye-Scherrer</H3>This object is exactly the same as the Ring Pattern object but the defaultsetting is for the defined x-ray beam. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Ring.DebyeShereDef.html">DefinitionDialog Box.</A><H3>One Dislocation Imaging<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H3>This object allows the user to simulate images of single dislocations. Itis based on a generalized, multi-slice, dynamic calculation using a twobeam approximation and the concept of diffraction contrast. The mathematicsare fully described in the monograph <A HREF="../references.html">ComputedElectron Micrographs and Defect Identification</A>. Major changes from thismonograph include the extension to a generalized crystal system and theincorporation of more physically intuitive methods for setting the imagingconditions. <H3>Two Dislocation Imaging<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H3>This object allows the user to simulate images of two dislocations and threestacking faults. It is based on a generalized, multi-slice, dynamic calculationusing a two beam approximation and diffraction contrast. <H3>Real Lattice</H3>The Real Lattice object will plot a graphical representation of the reallattice. It supports individual crystals only. Plotting options includea unit cell, a unit lattice, a 2x2x2 lattice, a 4x4x4 lattice or a crystalshape representation. Atoms may be plotted with covalent, metallic, Vander Waals or ionic radii. Elements are plotted by color in color mode orby pattern if in the monochrome mode. Individual atoms may be labeled forquick identification. Atom color may be set, as well as background color.Individual atoms, atoms of a particular element, or a plane of interestmay be hidden. Desktop Microscopist supports rendering of the atoms to enhancethree dimensional perception. It is possible to determine three atom planes,two atom directions, distance between atoms and angles between atoms. Highlightingof nearest neighbors and next nearest neighbors is supported. Rotation ofthe crystal lattice is supported by x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, by free rotationand to specific plane or direction. <H3>Monte Carlo Modeling<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif" WIDTH="31"HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H3>This object allows the user to simulate particle interaction with the sample.It is based on the relatively standard single scattering methodology. Averagedensity, and average atomic weight are set using the defined unit cellsand the relative proportions as determined in the orientation dialog box.A broad range of distribution graphs are supplied: Projected Range, Pathlenght, As a function of depth or radial distribution: Excitions, ElectronEnergy Loss, Nuclear Energy Loss, Total Nuclear Damage, and as a functionof energy, the Backscatter and forward scattered energy distributions.<A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/MonteCarloDef.html">DefintionDialog Box</A><BR>Tabulated information include: Incident Z,Incident M,Target Z,Target M.Density,Thick. (nm), Inc. Ion Energy, Cutoff Energy, Initial Position, Initial Angle,Channel Width, Reduced Energy, # Back Scattered, # Emitted, Avg Proj Range,Avg Path Length. <H3>Phase Diagram:Object</H3>The phase diagram is Desktop Microscopist's only support of a non-crystallographicobject. It was designed to give on-line reference to standard phase diagrams.It plots a binary phase diagram of composition versus temperature. The phasediagram is stored as a set of Bezier Curves which approximate the experimentallydetermined phase diagram. Composition and temperature may be read directlyfrom cursors. In addition, composition is given in both atomic and weightpercentages. The phase diagram recognizes phase boundaries and will calculaterelative proportions of individual phases using the Lever rule. The currentset of phase diagrams is limited but will be expanded with future upgrades.With version 2.0 a Phase Diagram editor has been released. This allows theindividual researcher to store binary phase diagrams of interest to him.<H3>Image Acquisition:</H3>The Image Acquisition Object supports the real time importation of an imagefrom a CCD camera by an 8-bit Quick Capture or compatible image acquisitionboard. This object helps to quickly acquire a set of diffraction patternswhich may then be transported to the SAD or relevant derived object foranalysis and identification. This object supports some simplistic binaryoperations and will allow false coloration by intensity value. It is onlyavailable when a Quick Capture or compatible card is inserted. <BR><BR>This completes the summary of the Desktop Microscopist Objects which areavailable to users of Desktop Microscopist. Please refer to Chapter IV onMenus and Chapter V on Dialog Boxes for a complete description of specificfunctions. <H3><A HREF="DataInputObjects.html">Data Input/Output And Display Objects</A></H3><BR><BR><HR><I>Author:James T.
