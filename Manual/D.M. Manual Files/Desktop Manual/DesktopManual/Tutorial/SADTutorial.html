The click on the foil normal buttonto set the foil normal to&lt;111&gt; and the foil thickness to 200. Press&lt;return&gt; and the program will return to the main window and the desireddiffraction pattern will be plotted. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image303.gif" WIDTH="435" HEIGHT="292"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><UL>  <LI>Although Desktop Microscopist brings a great deal of flexibility tothe plotting of an appropriate diffraction pattern, the details of eacheffect is best discussed in the sections on <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Menus.html">Menus</A>and <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">Dialog Boxes</A>. Thepurpose of this section is to introduce three aspects of Desktop Microscopist.The first is the importation of PICT files, the second is the use of PICTfiles to obtain experimental diffraction data and the third is the use ofthe search feature to locate potential matches for the experimental patterns.  <LI><B>SAD:Tutorial:Importing;<BR></B>In addition to the crystal library, the phase diagram and the application,a PICT file labeled Sample 1 was also incorporated into the Desktop MicroscopistFolder. To access this file go to the <B>File Menu</B> and select the option<B>Place</B>... An <B>Open</B> dialog box will appear. Open the file <B>Sample1</B> and an experimental diffraction pattern will appear. The diffractionpattern may be positioned by simply clicking on it and moving the mouse.Click on the main beam and move the imported diffraction pattern so thatit coincides with the main beam of the calculated pattern. Notice that thecalculated pattern is visible through the experimental diffraction pattern. At this point, the user may wish to explore  the difference between thevarious  <B>Pict Transfer Modes</B>, do this by going to the <B>Edit Menu</B>and selecting the different<B> Transfer Modes</B>.  <LI>It will be necessary to set the correct conversion factor for convertingthe measured distances to reciprocal Angstroms. There are two methods toaccomplish this. The first technique is simply to input a camera lengthwhich is appropriate for the final magnification. This is accomplished byselecting the beam dialog box and changing the camera length.   <LI>The second method is to use the experimental camera length for thegiven instrument and then to set a magnification factor using options availableunder the <B>Exp. Info. Menu</B>. For this example set the camera lengthto 20 mm-&Aring;, then go to the <B>Exp. Info. Menu</B>. and select the<B>Get d-space + Plane (Ring Method)</B>. Displayed is a ring centered aroundthe calculated main beam center. Moving the mouse causes this ring to expandor contract. Set this ring so that it cuts through the closest g-vector.Press <B>&lt;option&gt; - M</B>. This will bring up the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Set%20MagnificationSAD.html">MagnificationDialog Box</A>. Set the size to 26 mm and press the <B>&lt;return&gt; </B>key.This sets the magnification for this picture. The distance that is set isfor the diameter of the ring.   <LI><I>Note: If trouble is experienced in finding the mid-point of thesmallest g-vector, the sighting ability may be improved by playing withthe Convergence Angle found in the Beam Definition dialog box. This optionsets the size of the 'bulls eye' which tracks the mouse as it is moved aroundthe screen. Increasing the convergence angle will increase the size of thebulls eye. </I>  <LI>Once the magnification has been set, the Ring may be used to readoff the d-spacing for the diffraction pattern. It should be possible toread three or four d-spacings. Note how as the ring is pulled out, Millerplane indices appear. These indices refer to the matrix crystal. Essentially,Desktop Microscopist is comparing the current d-spacing with the calculatedd-spacings for the matrix crystal. If there is a match, Desktop Microscopistwill print this in the second ruler line. d-spacings may be compared toany of the four crystals. To change crystals, go to the <B>Set ReferenceCrystal</B> menu item under the <B>Exp. Info. Menu</B>. A hierarchical menuitem will allow selection of the crystal desired for comparison of experimentalvalues.   <LI>The magnification may also be set by using the <B>Set Magnification- Line Method</B> option. This item allows the drawing of one  line.  Magnificationis set by the length of the  line. The line may be moved, and stretchedusing standard Macintosh interface techniques. Use the <B>&lt;option&gt;- M</B> command to bring up the <B>Magnification</B> dialog box. <BR><A HREF="SearchMatchTut.html">Move On To Search/Matching Crystals</A> </UL><HR><I>Author:James T.
