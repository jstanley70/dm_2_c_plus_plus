As previously stated, Desktop Microscopist will searchfour different sets of data. The first is the set of stored Desktop Microscopistcrystals (it will not search Diffract crystals), the second is the ElectronDiffraction Database, the third is the JCPDF Powder Diffraction Data Baseand the fourth is the NBS Crystal Database. The last three databases maybe purchased through Virtual Laboratories or from a third party.  Theirorganization and crystal coverage is different and the user needs to determinewhich database is best for the work at hand.  In general, the EDD has beenoptimized for standard TEM  data.  To search these files, .separate defaultsearch paths are used for the different databases. To change the searchpath(s), access the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Serach%20Dialog%20Box.html">SearchPath Dialog Box</A> under the file menu. <H3>Search Chemistry:</H3>Desktop Microscopist is most effective when the chemistry as well as somed-space information is available. For this example, go to the Set SearchChemistry option. A <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/PeriodicTableDialog.html">periodictable</A> will appear. Desktop Microscopist allows three different levelsof chemistry selection. The first is the <B>May Be Present</B> option. Anyelement which is highlighted under this option will be allowed but willnot be required when searching the data base.  <BR><BR>The second level of chemistry selection is <B>Must Be Present</B>;. Anyelement which is highlighted under this option will be required when searchingthe data base. If a crystal does not explicitly state that it has this elementin its composition, it will be eliminated during the search. This optionis extremely powerful and often times it is overused. Exclusion of the correctcrystal is possible. It is suggested that at most two elements are selectedunder this option. <BR><BR>The final level of chemistry selection is arrived at by elimination, anyelement which is not selected under <B>May be</B> or <B>Must be</B> presentis designated as a <B>Cannot</B> be present. Any crystal which containsa <B>Cannot</B> be present element is eliminated by Desktop Microscopist.<BR><BR>For the purposes of this tour, set all elements &lt; Na to <B>May Be Present</B>+ Ti. In addition, set Al to the <B>Must Be Present</B> state. Activatethe <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Serach%20Dialog%20Boxes.html">Search DialogBox</A> by selecting any of the three search methods: Search by D-spacing,Search by g-vector and Search by volume under the Search/Match menu. Itis possible to switch to any of the other two methods and an additionalmethod (by 2-theta) within the Search Dialog Box. At this time, experimentald-spacings (2.3 &Aring;, 2.0 &Aring;, 1.4 &Aring;, and 1.2 &Aring;) maybe input. If the EDD has been purchased, activate and search both the EDDand the Desktop Microscopist Crystals. Set the FOM (Figure of Merit) to85 and search the data base. The Figure of Merit is a weighting functionto determine the press frequency of the d-space values. The lower d-spacevalues are given more weight. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image25.gif" WIDTH="490" HEIGHT="326"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><H3><CENTER>Search Dialog Box</CENTER></H3><BR><BR>When the search is completed, the experimental d-space values may be comparedto the database values by clicking on the Pop-up menu just below the experimentaland matched list. Select the Al crystal values. They should match in a reasonablefashion. The Found Crystal Pop-up Menu contains the following information:The FOM;, the reduced crystal volume, the space group number, the spacegroup and the crystal chemistry. <H3>Additional comments:</H3><BR>To transfer crystals of interest to the main program, click on the SaveSelected Crystals check box and select the desired crystals. Quitting thesearch dialog box will create a list of the selected crystals below theSearch/Match Menu. A comparison ring pattern of any of these crystals isshown when the crystal under this menu is selected. Holding the shift keydown (in the main menu) will bring up a Crystal Definition Dialog Box. Usethe Load button to insert the crystal into any of the four main crystals.<BR><BR>All found crystals can be transferred by simply quitting without using theSave Selected Crystals check box. The complete list of found crystals willnow appear below the Search/Match Menu. <H3><BR>Tour Conclusion:</H3><BR>Upon the conclusion of this tour, the user now has a basic idea of the powerand capabilities of Desktop Microscopist. Only a small portion of DesktopMicroscopists abilities have been touched upon in this short tour. However,many of the basics and the basic understandings about how to utilize DesktopMicroscopist have been covered. The following section details all the primaryfeatures of Desktop Microscopist and gives more insight into the conceptsof Default parameters, Search/Match and experimental parameters. The nexttwo sections detail every command available in Desktop Microscopist from<A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Menus.html">Menu Items</A> and <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Dialogs.html">DialogBox</A>. <BR><BR><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Structure.html">Program Structure-&gt;:</A><BR><HR><I>Author:James T.
