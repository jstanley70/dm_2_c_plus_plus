Desktop Microscopist allowsthe user to calculate both plane and direction stereographic projections.It will also allow the user to view a plot where pole intensity can be representedby size and proportional intensity. The following directions demonstrateplotting a plane pole projection, the addition of a set of direction poles,the insertion of a tensile axis, the determination of angular distance betweentwo plane poles and finally the <A HREF="DefectAnalysisTut.html">identificationof a dislocation direction.</A><BR>From the File Menu, pull down to the New Menu Item, a hierarchical menuwill appear, select the item marked.

Desktop Microscopist will now calculate and plot astandard stereographic projection for Al3Ti with the pole size dependenton the most intense structure factor for that position. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image18.gif" WIDTH="345" HEIGHT="357"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><B>Sample Stereographic Projection</B></CENTER><UL>  <LI>All graph windows have a special section which is located across thetop. This section, called the <A HREF="../Desktop%20Objects/Datapresentationdevices.html">ruler</A>;,contains various <A HREF="../Desktop%20Objects/Datapresentationdevices.html">buttons</A>,and space for two lines. The upper line above the buttons is provided forshort help instructions. When selecting a new function look to this linefor a brief description of how the function is activated. The line belowthe row of buttons lists the function and will contain any information generatedby the function cursor. Look to this line for specific information whichmay be calculated from actions taken on the screen such as d-spacings orangle between planes, etc. When clicked, the square buttons give informationabout the item described on the button. The button labeled Crystal 1 whenclicked gives a brief description of Crystal 1 (the Matrix crystal). Doubleclicking on the button will bring-up the respective <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/CrystalDef.gif">DefinitionDialog Box</A>.<BR><BR>  <LI>Information about each of the plotted poles is available in an interactivefashion. To obtain it, go to the menu labeled Info and select the item markedPole Info. The arrow cursor changes to the <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Cursors.html">bulls-eyecursor</A>. To view the available information, click and hold down on thepole of interest and a pop-up menu will appear in the top left corner witha list of useful information. Holding the shift key down when clicking inthe same location allows information about the set of planes which may belocated at the same position in projection space to be displayed. DesktopMicroscopist beeps once upon completion of a cycle.<BR><BR>  <LI>To learn the angle between two crystals, select <B>Angle Between Spots</B>under the Info menu. Next, while holding the <B>&lt;shift&gt; </B>key,click on a pole of interest. This pole has now been 'set' as the referencepole. Selecting any other pole on the projection displays the angle betweenit and the reference pole. Continual selection will give angular informationwith respect to the reference pole. To change the reference pole, hold downthe &lt;shift&gt; key while selecting a new pole.<BR><BR>  <LI>If it is desired to work with a specific set of higher poles, it ispossible to view these poles without plotting the entire stereographic projectionto the same high index. Desktop Microscopist allows specific poles and classesof poles to be plotted as needed.
