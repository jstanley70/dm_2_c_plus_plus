To obtain the diffractionpattern caused by such a physical system, two additional questions mustfirst be answered. First, what is the relative proportion of each component;and second, what is the orientation of each crystal with respect to theprimary or matrix crystal. <H3>Setting The Orientation relationship: </H3>Orientation relationships are accomplished via the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/PPtInfoDialogBox.html">PPTInfo</A> or orientation relationship dialog box. Proper use of this dialogbox helps Desktop Microscopist accurately calculate diffraction patternsfor twins, crystals related by a martensitic transformation and solid stateprecipitates. It is possible to define rational (standard solid state precipitationreactions) and irrational orientation relationships. <BR><BR>Setting a rational orientation relationship is accomplished by setting paralleltwo sets of two non-tangential planes or directions, one from each crystal.This action is described in the following figure. An irrational orientationrelationship is described by first orienting the planes, as for a rationalorientation relationship and then rotating the crystals about the firstaxis (either the plane normal pole or the direction) of the matrix crystaland then rotating the crystals about the second axis of the matrix. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../Dialog%20Boxes/ORExplained.gif" WIDTH="397" HEIGHT="162" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </CENTER><P>There is a great deal of flexibility in setting a rational orientationrelationship. It is possible to set either planes or directions parallelin any paired combination and the two sets of planes/directions need notbe orthogonal. <BR><I>The only requirement for accurate calculation of the orientation matrixis that the angular relationship between the matrix poles be the same asthe angular relationship between the precipitate poles. <BR></I>For example, it is permissible to define the following relationshipfor 2 cubic crystals: <BR><P><CENTER>&lt;100&gt;matrix || &lt;011&gt;ppt<BR>(110)matrix || (001)ppt<BR>(the angle between the plane normal and the direction is 45&#176; for bothcrystals). </CENTER><P>However, the relationship: <BR><P><CENTER>&lt;100&gt;matrix || &lt;011&gt;ppt<BR>(011)matrix || (001)ppt </CENTER><P>cannot be defined. <UL>  <LI>While in theory there is a great deal of flexibility, in practiceit is strongly suggested that an orientation relationship be defined whichuses a direction set and a plane set of poles which are orthogonal (dotproduct = 0). Following this simple rule will eliminate any potential difficultiesthat may occur with respect to accurate representation. <BR>For purposes of this demonstration, set the following orientation relationship:<BR><BR>  <LI><CENTER>100&gt;matrix || 0-1-1&gt;ppt<BR>(011)matrix || (100)ppt </CENTER></UL>Setting this relationship is very similar to setting the atomic positionsin the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/CrystalDM.html">Crystal dialog box</A>.Simply click on the values to change and type in the proper information.However, the following points need to be made:<UL>  <LI>Clicking on the enter box when the parallel column is active willchange the value Plane to Direction and vice versa.  <LI>When entering Miller indices, Desktop Microscopist supports <B>doubledigit index values.</B>   <LI>To utilize this feature a <SPACE> or a ,&gt; must be placed betweeneach number. <I>It is not required to place the delimiting value if no Millerindex is greater than 9</I>.   <LI>Example 12 <SPACE>9 <SPACE>7 <SPACE> is correct but 12 <SPACE>97 willbe incorrectly interpreted by Desktop Microscopist as (12 97 0).   <LI>Entering Negative Values:  <UL>    <LI>To enter a negative value hold the <OPTION>key while pressing thedesired number.  </UL></UL><BR>(The above issues are coverd in more detail in the section on <A HREF="../MathAndMisc/Keyboard%20Equivalents.html">Useof the Keyboard , Short Cuts and Features</A> .)<BR><BR>The Variant button and the definition of more than one orientation relationshipare discussed in the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/ORDialogbox.html">OrientationDialog Box</A> section. <BR>At this point, the user has defined two crystals, and an orientation relationshipbetween them.
