Desktop Microscopist allows specific poles and classesof poles to be plotted as needed. Going to the Function menu and selectingthe item. Add Spot; will result in the pole definition dialog box: <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image22.gif" WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="187" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><H3><CENTER>Add Spots Dialog</CENTER></H3>Select the desired index, in this case, the (456) pole, click the choiceof plane or direction and select the crystal, either Matrix, ppt. 1,ppt.2,or ppt. 3 from the pop-up menu. <BR>Checking the Add Type box will plot all the {456} poles of that index. Toplot these poles, click on the OK button or press &lt;return&gt;. The dialogbox will remain but the poles will be plotted. Since, the stereographicprojection only plots for the first crystal of each type, the poles areplotted with respect to the first defined orientation relationship.<BR>Additional sets of planes or direction poles may be added in this fashion.When finished, clicking on Quit will provide a return to the main window.<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image23.gif" WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="159" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Add Tensile Axis Dialog</CENTER><P>I.	It is possible to plot a pole with a specific angular relationshipwith respect to some other pole. To do this go to the Function menu andselect the .i.Add Tensile Axis;... item. The Tensile Axis Dialog Box willbe displayed.. When this dialog box is open, poles may be added with eitherthe mouse or by typing in the angles of interest. m is vertical and l isthe horizontal axis.<BR>To use the mouse, simply hold the mouse button down and move the cursorto the desired position. This action will result in the angular positionbeing displayed in the dialog box. Clicking on OK will add the desired poleand give the closest equivalent Miller direction index.<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image24.gif" WIDTH="368" HEIGHT="237" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><H3><CENTER>Trace Analysis Dialog Box</CENTER></H3>138.	The stereogram will now orient to the second crystal orientation. Again,set the dislocation line direction by rotating the great circle, this timeto 22 degrees clockwise. A new pole will appear at the crossover of thetwo great circles. This is the true line direction of the dislocation. Goto the Function menu and select Irrational Direction. By moving the cursorover the newly plotted pole, the indices of the determined pole can be read.Clicking on the newly defined pole while in the info function will alsoprovide this information. The answer should be approximately [-1 12 -1].<BR>1.	Due to the large number of available functions, it may be worthwhileto spend a little more time exploring the capabilities of this portion ofthe program. For now, go back to the definition dialog box, (found underthe Function Menu), click on Matrix and Ppt #1 set to 1 and 2 and re-plotit. Finally, re-size the plot by using the grow box in the bottom rightcorner to a small window and then go to Re-plot under the Function Menu.The stereogram has now been re-sized to fit the size of the window.<BR><H3><A HREF="SADTutorial.html">On To the SAD Tutorial:-&gt;</A></H3><P><CENTER></CENTER><P><UL>  <LI><HR><I>Author:James T.
