TheDefault Settings contain all the information that can be designated whenthe application has no windows. Defaults can be set for the four crystals,their orientation relationships, the settings for plotting (the plottingparameters are found under the Edit Menu - Set Plot Parameters), crystalshape, crystal elastic constants and parameters of the electron and x-raybeams. When a new window is opened, the default parameters are automaticallyinserted into the current fields. By utilizing the concept of default parameters,it gives each window independence from other windows thereby allowing thecomparison of crystals with different structures. Alternatively, crystallographicinformation may be transferred from one object window to another by utilizingthe default crystals as a clip board. This is achieved by transferring thedesired source crystal into a default crystal and then opening the destinationcrystal and retrieving the appropriate default value.<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image12.gif" WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="180"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">103. </CENTER><H3><CENTER>Figure 5</CENTER></H3>Desktop Microscopist allows three different methods for setting DefaultParameters and three similar methods for accessing default parameters. Oneexample of the first method for setting Default parameters has already beencompleted. When there are no table or graphing windows active, any parameterswhich are changed effect the Default settings. The second method occurswhen the Dump option is accessed. This option is available inside all dialogboxes which are accessed under the Parameter Menu.<BR>When in an object, if the Matrix Crystal Parameters are changed, clickingon the Dump button brings up the Load / Dump Dialog. Selecting one of theoptions displayed therein will cause the information associated with thecurrent crystal to be inserted into the selected crystal. As an example;when the Matrix crystal for an active object is being defined and Dump isselected, then when the Matrix button under the Default Crystals Columnis clicked, the currently defined parameters will be inserted into the defaultmatrix crystal. The current dialog box data may also be transferred to anyof the other relevant crystals. For example, the current matrix CrystalDefinition may be inserted into the Default PPt#1 crystal, the local PPt#1crystal, etc. <BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual<BR></A><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: VirtualLabs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
