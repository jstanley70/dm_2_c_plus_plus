Spherical Aberrationsare caused by changes in the image due to radial variation in the lens focallenght. Chromatic Aberrations are caused by changes in the image due tovariation in the lens focal length as the result of particle-waves withdifferent energies.<BR><BR><B>base crystal: </B>The base crystal is the crystal that the beam or thecomputer screen is oriented with respect too. The most common situationis for the matrix crystal to be the base crystal. However, if the matrixcrystal is not active when the diffraction or stereogram is initially orientedthe lowest numbered precipitate becomes the base crystal. Be aware thatthe Matrix crystal is still the reference for any orientation relationshipsand therefore orientations between crystals will necessary the base crystal.<BR><BR><B>Bragg Condition: </B>A crystal is considered to be in the Bragg Conditionwhen the Ewald Sphere is oriented such that it passes through a specifiedg-vector . In TEM this condition is considered to be achieved when the KikuchiBand is oriented such that the outside of the band passes through the originand the g-vector of interest. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image292.gif" WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="196"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Calculated Example of the Bragg Condition.</CENTER><P><B>Contrast Transfer Function (CTF):<BR></B>The Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) is the function which describesthe effect of the objective lens imperfections and the aperature on theintensity of the diffracted beams. It is typically plotted in reciprocalAngstroms and varies from -1 to +1. Desktop uses the model described onpages 526 - 530 of <A HREF="../references.html">High-Resolution TransmissionElectron Micrscopy and Associated Techniques</A> for the calculation ofits CTF. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image343.gif" WIDTH="262" HEIGHT="194"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P><B>Laue Circle:</B> The Laue Circle is determined by setting a vectorfrom the center of a zone axis to the actual beam direction. Rotating thisvector about the center of the zone axis then sets the Laue Circle. Thisinitial Laue Circle corresponds to the locus of points in the diffractionplane which are at the Bragg Condition (highly excited) and is consideredthe zero order Laue Circle. Additional order's of Laue Circles are set bydetermination of the locus of points for successive layers of the latticeplanes. The concept of the Laue Circle can be used to exactly specify acrystal orientation with respect to an exciting beam. <A HREF="../references.html">SeeSpence and Zuo.</A><BR><BR><B>Laue Condition: </B>A crystal is considered to be in the Laue Conditionwhen the Ewald Sphere is symmetrically oriented with respect to a specified&#177;g-vector pair. In TEM this condition is considered to be achievedwhen the Kikuchi Band is Midway between the &#177;g-vector pair. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image291.gif" WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="248"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Calculated Example of a Laue Condition.</CENTER><P><B>log dynamic range: </B>An empirical number used by Desktop Micrscopistto determine the size and relative intensity of diffraction spots. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamDefinitionDialogBox.html">Increasingits value </A>will cause the diffraction pattern to flatten out in appearance(decrease contrast).<BR><BR><B>Systematic Row:</B>  Essentially, a systematic row is the row of diffractionintensities that can be generated from a single g-vector.  Typically, theconcept is associated with the 2-beam condition.<B><BR>tilt direction,direction of tilt: </B>When rotating a crystal about an axisthrough the origin, the tilt direction corresponds to the direction crystalpoles move when tilting in a positive direction.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.ames T.Stanley <BR></A><IMG SRC="../../DesktopLogoTOC.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual<BR></A><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: VirtualLabs</A><BR>Last Updated:July 6,1996</I> </BODY></HTML>
