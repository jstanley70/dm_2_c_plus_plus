Itis possible to control the shape of the plotted point, the color of eachcrystal, labeling of the crystal and whether the plot will be for a monochromeor color monitor. The user is also given control over what units structurefactors are displayed in, whether Debye-Waller factors are considered, andif Desktop is to use a Bloch Wave Dynamic calculation to determine intensty.<BR>In addition, hexagonal crystals can be labeled using either a four or athree index system. (See appendix A: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Math.html">TheMathematics of Desktop Microscopist</A> for an explanation of how the conversionis calculated.) <BR>The Control of these general issues is supported in three distinct DialogBoxes: <UL>  <LI><A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/PlotParametersDialog.html">Set Plot ShapesDialog Box</A><BR>(Allows The User To Set the Shape of the Plotted Diffraction Pattern)   <LI><A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Misc.%20Parameters%20Dialog.html">Set Misc.Parameters</A>   <UL>    <LI>(Controls hkil for hexagonal, linking, Background Color, In Colorand the amount of rotation the arrow keys work)   </UL>  <LI><A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/StructureFactorDialogBox.html">StructureFactor </A>  <UL>    <LI>Controls how the structure factor is calculated and displayed.   </UL>  <LI><A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Default-%3EPreferenceDialog.html">Set Default&lt;-&gt; Local</A>   <UL>    <LI>Allows the user to transfer data into the default parameters (allnew windows will have these values) and the preference file (when openingthe program, default prameters will be set to the current values). Also,allows the user to retrieve default and preference file values into thecurrent window.   </UL></UL><H3><CENTER>Plot Parameters</CENTER></H3><UL>  <LI>Set the geometric figure used to represent plane poles, diffractionmaximum and directions for various graphical representations. The real latticeplot is not effected by these parameters.   <LI>Set whether Desktop Microscopist will plot in monochrome or 8-bitcolor. This feature does apply to all objects. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/PlotParametersDialog.html">SetPlot Shapes Dialog Box</A>   <LI>Set whether hexagonal planes and directions are represented by a threeor four index system. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Misc.%20Parameters%20Dialog.html">SetMisc. Parameters</A>   <LI>Set three levels of linkage between windows. No linking, windows areunconnected and values changed within one window do not effect other windows.Static Linking changes in one window effect other linked windows but theeffect is seen only when the window is brought to the front. Dynamic Linkingchanges in one window are immediately displayed in all linked windows. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Misc.%20Parameters%20Dialog.html">SetMisc. Parameters</A>   <LI>Activate/deactivate the use of Debye Waller factors in the calculationof structure factor values.Determine whether structure factors will be displayedin eV or &Aring;-1. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/StructureFactorDialogBox.html">StructureFactor </A>  <LI>The two buttons at the bottom (Revert to Previous Defaults and SetDefaults to Current) offer a second method for manipulating the Defaultsettings. By clicking on Revert to Previous Defaults button the currentcrystals, orientation relationships etc. will be set to the stored defaultsettings. The second button, Set Defaults to Current, will set the defaultsettings to the current crystals, orientation relationships, etc. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Default-%3EPreferenceDialog.html">SetDefault &lt;-&gt; Local</A>   <LI>For certain windows, it is possible to tilt the crystal by steps usingthe arrow keys. The Tilt Step sets the size of these tilts in degree. Therefore,setting the Tilt Step to 5&#176; will rotate the crystal by five degreesin the selected direction. Currently, this feature is active in the RealLattice section. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Misc.%20Parameters%20Dialog.html">SetMisc. Parameters</A> </UL><H3>Notes: </H3><UL>  <LI>The two buttons in the Set Default &lt;-&gt; to Local Dialog Box allowthe changing of all settings with a single action.<A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Default-%3EPreferenceDialog.html">SetDefault &lt;-&gt; Local</A>   <LI>CAUTION! These two buttons are irreversible! Once the defaults havebeen set to the current crystals, orientation relationships etc., the originalset of default settings cannot be retrieved. </UL><B>For purposes of this tutorial: </B>Set the matrix plane to plot as a'X'. Click on the button, Spot Shape - Planes and the button will changeto Spot Shape - Direction. Set the matrix direction to plot as a '+'. Thesesymbols may be changed to any particular preference at any time. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/PlotParametersDialog.html">SetPlot Shapes Dialog Box</A> <BR><BR><BR>After working with these four dialogs and completing the previous sectionsof the tutorial, the user has set all the necessary parameters to obtainuseful diffraction patterns and stereographic projections. The <A HREF="StereoObj.html">StereographicProjection Object</A> will now be used to determine a stereographic projectionof the matrix.<HR><I>Author:James T.
