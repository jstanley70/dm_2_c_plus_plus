Stereographic projectionsare frequently used in crystallography to understand crystal deformationand crystal symmetry. One additional use is in the analysis of defect structure.It is common to use the stereographic projection in conjunction with TEMmicrographs of dislocation structures to determine the direction vectorfor a dislocation line. <BR><BR>This concept is illustrated in the following figure. Use the knowledge ofthe crystal orientation determined from the diffraction pattern, and theprojection of the dislocation from two orientations of the crystal it ispossible to uniquely determine a dislocation direction(within a 180&#176;rotation). Desktop Microscopist simplifies this task by simplifying theorienting of a crystal and immediately returning the Miller index at thecross-over of the two dislocation projections. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image19.gif" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="263"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>This analysis may be obtained by going to the Function menu and selectingFind a Defect Direction... This will bring up a <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Find%20Defect%20Direction.html">dialogbox</A> which will allow the definition of two orientations for the stereogram.Set the first orientation for the crystal as described in the followingfigure, do the same for the second orientation. Press the &lt;return&gt;key. The stereogram will orient itself to the first specified orientationand draw a great circle through the center of the stereogram. At this point,orient the great circle to align with the projected dislocation line. Toorient the great circle, move the mouse cursor. For purposes of this examplerotate to thirty degrees counterclockwise and click once. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image20.gif" WIDTH="368" HEIGHT="237"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><B>Trace Analysis Dialog Box</B></CENTER><P>The stereogram will now orient to the second crystal orientation. Again,set the dislocation line direction by rotating the great circle, this timeto 22 degrees clockwise. A new pole will appear at the crossover of thetwo great circles. This is the true line direction of the dislocation. Goto the Function menu and select Irrational Direction. By moving the cursorover the newly plotted pole, the indices of the determined pole can be read.Clicking on the newly defined pole while in the info function will alsoprovide this information. The answer should be approximately [-1 12 -1].<BR><BR>Due to the large number of available functions, it may be worthwhile tospend a little more time exploring the capabilities of this portion of theprogram. For now, go back to the definition dialog box, (found under theFunction Menu), click on Matrix and Ppt #1 set to 1 and 2 and re-plot it.Finally, re-size the plot by using the grow box in the bottom right cornerto a small window and then go to Re-plot under the Function Menu. The stereogramhas now been re-sized to fit the size of the window. <H3><A HREF="SADTutorial.html">Move On To Plotting SAD Patterns:</A></H3><BR><I>Author:James T.
