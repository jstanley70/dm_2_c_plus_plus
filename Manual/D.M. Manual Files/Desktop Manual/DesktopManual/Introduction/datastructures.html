The original Desktop supported five different fileconfigurations, four of which were specific to Desktop Microscopist or Diffract,its immediate predecessor. An additional 3 data types have been added withthis new version. The following is a brief description of the eight filetypes which are supported by Desktop Microscopist. <H3>Diffract v1.0 to v1.5.</H3><BR>Desktop Microscopist will import crystals defined using Diffract v1.0  throughv1.5 in a seamless fashion. These files may only be accessed from the CrystalDefinition Dialog Box. <H3>PICT Format</H3>Desktop Microscopist will allow the importation of PICT ;files in the appropriateobject. PICT files are imported by selecting the Import function from theFile menu. <H3>Desktop Microscopist Files </H3>Desktop Microscopist Files have two primary types of data files: Crystalfiles and files associated with each of the primary calculating objects.Each data file type has its own special icon. Desktop Microscopist has beenwritten so that all files may be accessed from the Open command under theFile menu. The selected file will be opened in the appropriate boxes, allpertinent parameters will be set to the original values and the plot willbe re-graphed. Desktop Microscopist will read 1.0 crystals and files. However,files stored in 2.0 format are not backward compatible and will cause D.M.1.x to crash! <H3>Phase Diagram Object</H3>Desktop Microscopist supports the Phase Diagram Object files. This formathas been significantly changed from version 1.0. In this version, each PhaseDiagram is stored as a separate item. This change was precipitated by thedevelopment of a distributable Phase Diagram editor which allows individualsto store new phase diagrams. Phase Diagrams need to be stored inside a singlefolder. You may store files into sub-folders for improved organization.<BR><H3>Electron Diffraction Database</H3>Desktop Microscopist can search and retrieve crystals stored using the compressedfile structure developed by Marty Carr and co-workers at Sandia NationalLabs. This is a 88,000+ database of crystals which are stable under an electronbeam. The database is distributed by the International Centre for PowderDiffraction Files. <H3>JCPDF Powder Diffraction File</H3>The JCPDF Powder Diffraction File.  Desktop Microscopist 2.0 will searchand retrieve crystals stored in the JCPDF Powder Diffraction File. Thisis a 230,000+ database of crystals that includes organic and inorganic compounds.This database is based on reported experimental data. The database is distributedby the International Centre for Powder Diffraction Files.<H3>The NBS/NIST Crystal Database</H3>Desktop Microscopist searches and retrieves crystals stored in the NBS/NISTCrystal Database. This is a 230,000+ database of organic and inorganic crystals.Its strength is the storage of searchable primitive crystals. The databaseis distributed by the .i.International Centre for Powder Diffraction Files.<H3>Text Files:</H3>Desktop Microscopist 2.0 will input and/or output many data objects in ASCIItext format. These include Spectra, crystals, calculated intensities andlocations etc.   <BR>To input a spectra, use a Graph Object.<BR><BR><A HREF="IconImages.html">Program Icons-&gt; </A><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.amesT.
