Desktop Microscopist offers a wide range of standard numerical and graphicalrepresentations for basic electron and x-ray diffraction. <H2>Numerical Data</H2><BR>The numerical data is presented in tabular form and includes d-spacings,angle between planes, angle between directions, periodicities, structurefactors, extinction distances and a plane calculator called Useful Infowhich gives specific information for two selected planes. Where appropriate,Desktop Microscopist will allow calculation and tabulation of data betweenoriented crystals. As an example, it is possible to calculate all planeswhich meet a specified d-space and angle values between the matrix and anoriented crystal. <H2>Graphical Representations</H2><BR>The graphical representations are consistent with the specific method beingsimulated. Graphical representations include crystal modeling using renderedshading to enhance 3-dimensional perception, SAD, CBED, HOLZ, powder-ringrepresentations, diffractometer, <A HREF="../Tutorial/StereoObj.html">stereographicprojections</A>, Kikuchi, Kossel, Laue back, Laue transmission patterns,Monte Carlo simulations, and one and two dislocation image simulation. Eachof the current calculations is dependent on a kinematic approximation whichuses the concept of a reciprocal lattice and the calculation of structurefactors at a single point to calculate pertinent intensities. <H2>I. Single Crystal Techniques</H2><BR>The objects which calculate graphical representations of essentially singlecrystal techniques, such as SAD, CBED, Kossel and Laue transmission patterns,have been designed to simulate the experimental data as found on TEM andx-ray negatives. Consequently, the results are graphical in nature and easilycorrelated with experimental data. Within each object, it is possible todefine four different crystal types (the matrix crystal and three differentprecipitates) and to use these four crystals to define three sets of orientedcrystals. Each set of oriented crystals can contain an indefinite numberof oriented crystals limited only by available memory. In reality, it willseldom be necessary to define more than 24 orientations for each crystal.. <H2> Diffracted intensities</H2><BR>Diffracted intensities; are determined by a wavelength compensated structurefactor calculation, the scattering angle and the beam type.  Diffractedintensities can take into account <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/StructureFactorDialogBox.html">Debye-WallarFactors, dynamic interactions and the effects of absorption.</A> Atomicscattering factors are stored in the program and are taken from calculationsdone by <A HREF="../references.html">Doyle and Turner and the 1974 editionof the International Tables for X-Ray Crystallography</A>.   The valuesmay be <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Atomic%20Scattering%20Dialog.html">edited</A>. In addition to the calculation of the various patterns, Desktop Microscopistallows significant flexibility with respect to labeling and specific spotaddition/subtraction, pattern rotation and pattern movement. It is alsopossible to derive experimental and calculated data from specific pointsof maximum intensity.<H2>II.<A HREF="../Tutorial/StereoObj.html">Stereographic Projection</A></H2><BR>Stereographic Projections object has been designed as a highly interactiveproblem solving tool. Plane pole and direction stereograms for any systemare quickly plotted to desired indices. Plane pole patterns can be plottedwith pole size directly dependent on structure factor amplitude. Specificpole and directions can be easily added to the plotted stereogram, eitherindividually, by type or based on symmetry arguments. Stereograms basedon the orientation relationships between the four primary crystals can beplotted. The crystals can be rotated around the center, to the center, tohorizontal and to vertical by a single mouse click. In addition, <A HREF="NewWithTwo.html">version2.0</A> supports the rotation of the stereogram about a specific pole. Traceanalysis and habit plane identification techniques have been included andthe dislocation analysis portion has been specifically designed for easyand accurate determination of dislocation directions. Specific poles anddirections can be fixed and the crystal rotated about them. It is also possibleto add tensile axes at non-integer Miller positions. Finally, most quantitativeresults, available in the diffraction pattern section of the program, canbe obtained from a given stereogram. <H2>III. Kikuchi pattern and Kossel line objects</H2><BR>The Kikuchi pattern and Kossel line objects allows calculation of a 90&#176;map of the Kikuchi and Kossel maps, as calculated based solely on geometricand structural calculations. Specific K-lines are determined using the respectivestructure factor calculation and angular distance from the correspondingpole. Low indexed zone axis poles are located by symbols. It is possibleto calculate a K-Map of two or more crystals. Rotation of the K-map is allowedaround the center, to the center, to horizontal and to vertical. A zoom-infeature helps the crystallographer obtain a more accurate feel for how theK-map of a particular crystal will appear on the negative. K-lines can belabeled by simply clicking on the line of interest. K-maps can be used asan excellent tutorial when working with a new crystal and can save hourson the microscope. These maps can be plotted in grey scale to approximateintensity or in color mode to aid in identification. <H2>IV. Diffractometer & Ring Patterns</H2><BR>The diffractometer object, the Debye-Scherrer and the ring pattern objectsallow plots of poly-grained samples. These objects calculate intensitiesand positions based on first order assumptions of complete random orientationwith no consideration for grain size effects. These calculations do considerthe weighting effect of similar poles and the Diffractometer object doesinclude a .i.Lorentz polarization factor ;. <H2>V. Real Lattice</H2><BR>The real lattice section of the program plots unit cells, a unit slice ofthe lattice, eight (2x2x2) unit cells, 64 (4x4x4) unit cells and the crystalshape. The three dimensional lattice may be rendered to achieve some senseof depth. an individual plane of atoms may be selected and subsequentlyrotated for ease of viewing. Crystals may be rotated by degrees, freely,to a specific plane and to a specific direction. Desktop Microscopist supportslabeling of atoms, selective coloring of atoms by elemental type, determinationof nearest and next nearest neighbors. The plane and angle of three atomsor the direction and distance between two atoms may also be determined.<H2>VI. Phase Diagram</H2><BR>The phase diagram subsection allows the user to view binary phase diagramsof important binary systems. Determination of the relative amounts of constituents,exact compositions and temperatures can also be instantly determined fromthe plot. Phase diagrams can be dynamically shrunk and enlarged and printedto any connected printer. A new Phase Diagram Editor lets the user add phasediagrams of interest. This Phase Diagram Editor is <H2>VII. Data input</H2><BR>Data input Desktop Microscopist includes standard definitions for the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/CrystalDM.html">unitcell</A>, <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/PPtInfoDialogBox.html">orientationrelationships</A>, <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/CrystalShapeDialog.html">crystalmorphology and size</A>, <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/ElasticConstantsDialog.html">crystalelastic constants</A> and <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamDefinitionDialogBox.html">specificdescription of the incident beam</A>. To aid and simplify the data input,the program contains a large quantity of atomic parameters including atomic,covalent and ionic radii for the elements, atomic x-ray and electron scatteringfactors for all elements and many ions, and a compressed version of thestandard space group definitions for the 230 crystalline space groups. Itis also possible to add or edit atomic scattering factors using a built-ineditor for this purpose. Desktop Microscopist comes with a library of standardcrystals and phase diagrams intended for tutorial and reference purposes.<H1><BR><A HREF="NewWithTwo.html">New With Version 2.0</A> </H1><HR><I>Author: <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">James T.Stanley <BR></A></I><IMG SRC="../../FrontPage/FrontPageImages/DesktopLogo.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP><I><A HREF="../../FrontPage/Start"></A></I><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">Desktop Manual<BR></A><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: VirtualLabs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
