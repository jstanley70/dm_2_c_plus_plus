Simulation:</H3><H4>A. Crystal Defects</H4>It is now possible to simulate dislocation and stacking faults using twobeam dynamical assumptions. This work is based on the classic study by <A HREF="../references.html">A.K.Head, P. Humble, L.M. Clarebrough, A.J. Morton and C.T. Forwood.</A> Theirwork has been extended to a generalized crystal system and a more experimentalmethodology is used for establishing input parameters. Sets of images canbe calculated and displayed for image comparison and selection. <H4>B. Particle Interactions</H4>You can now simulate particle interactions using <A HREF="../Desktop%20Objects/WindowObjects.html">MonteCarlo </A>techniques. The program automatically calculates density basedon the unit cell definition and will calculate an average density basedon a mix of crystals, supports beam tilts with respect to the foil surfaceand plots a variety of energy and particle interaction distributions asa function of depth and radial distance from impact. Graphed results canbe output in ascii format for inclusion in reports, further data reductionor incorporation in a sophisticated graphing program. <H4>C. Particle Streaking</H4>You can simulate the effect of streaking on SAD diffraction patterns.  Desktopsupports two methods for calculating streaking caused by particle sahpe. The <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Ppt.%20Streaking%20Setup.html">first method</A>is rapid and is based on the simple premise that streaking extends primarilyperpendicular to the crystal face to a length inversely proportional tothe thickness of the crystal through that face.  The <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Ppt.%20Streaking%20Setup.html">second streaking calculation</A> is based on the fourier transform of the shapefunction for the selected precipitate and Dsktop will plot function changeas a function of distance from the Ewald sphere. Therefore, it should giveaccurate images of satellite spots etc. The resolution of the image is adjustableand may be plotted in grey scale or in precipitate color.  Use the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Ppt.%20Streaking%20Setup.html">Ppt.Streaking Setup Dialog Box </A>to activate and set this calculation.<H4>CBED Bloch Calculations</H4>With version 2.0, it is now possible to generate full dynamic simulationsfor CBED patterns, obtain rocking curves, calculation of intensity as afunction of thickness and calculation of intensity as a function of voltage.These calculations can take in the effects of absorption, thermal fluctuations,sample thickness and foil normal. Calculations are based on the excellenttreatment of <A HREF="../references.html">Spence and Zuo</A> . To use thisfeature, go to the CBED object and look for  the <A HREF="../Menu%20Items/CBEDMenuItems.html">BlochCalculations Menu.</A><BR><H4>E. Full SAD Diffraction Simulations</H4>It is possible to calculate a full simulation of an SAD diffraction patternincluding both diffraction spots, K-lines and the effects of streaking.<H3>VI. Data Input:</H3><H4>A. Stage Tilts!!!!</H4>Stage Tilts can now be used to orient the crystal. Either double tilt orsingle tilt stages can be simulated. The tilt axis can be aligned to themicroscope. If, experiments are being conducted on a known crystal, thisfeature will allow calculation of x-y tilts to a zone axis of interest.Alternatively, with an unknown crystal, utilizing this feature will allowcalculation of a primitive lattice based on two zone axis diffraction patternsand the tilts between them. Use the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Stage%20Control%20Dialog%20Box.html">StageTilt Dialog Box</A> found under the <A HREF="../Menu%20Items/ParameterMenu.html">ParameterMenu</A>. <H4>B. Debye Waller factors</H4>Debye Waller factors are now included for atomic positions and can be utilizedin the calculation of structure factors. <H4>C. Debye Temperatures</H4>Debye Temperatures and a simple method for calculating <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/DebyeTempCalc.html">DWfactors</A> based on the Debye Temperature and the Atomic Weight have beenincorporated into the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/CrystalDM.html">CrystalDefinition</A>. Alternatively, you can input the desired DW factor manually.Structure factor calculations can incorporate the DW factor or they canbe ignored. <H4>D. A Contrast Transfer Function</H4>A Contrast Transfer Function for the microscope objective lens can now beplotted and important defocus values are automatically calculated. Use the<A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/ContrastTransfer.html">Lens Transfer FunctionDialog Box</A> found under the <A HREF="../Menu%20Items/ParameterMenu.html">ParameterMenu</A>. <H4>E. New Beam Type</H4>Ions can now be used as the accelerated beam. <H4>F. Beam Orientation</H4>A more complete and exact method for orienting the crystal has been incorporatedinto Desktop Microscopist. There is now a set of orientation methodologiesto support Scientest's with different needs or inclinations. The beam canbe oriented based on Zone Axis, Plane Normal, Z.A. off of laue towards azone, around a g-vector, Z.A. off of Bragg towards a zone, or around a g-vectoror using the laue circle coordinates as described in <A HREF="../references.html">ElectronMicrodiffraction by Spence and Zuo.</A> <BR>See The <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamOrientationDialog.html">Beam OrientationDialog Box</A> for more detail. <H4>G. Experimental Diffractometer Spectra</H4>Diffractometer spectra can now be input and compared with calculated values.These spectra need to be in ascii format, single column, values separatedby a return. <H3>XIV. Integration:</H3><H4><A HREF="../Desktop%20Objects/ControlDefaultParamters.html">LinkingBetween Windows</A></H4>You can now link windows so that base parameters remain the same. This linkagecan be dynamic or static. <BR>A new feature with Desktop Microscopist 2.0, is the ability to link windows.When windows are linked they maintain the same crystals, the same orientationrelationships, the same stage orientation, and the same beam orientation.This allows the user to quickly update various representations of the experimentalsituation efficiently, and to gain some insight into the relationship betweenreciprocal space and the corresponding real space representation. Linkingcan be either dynamic or static. If, dynamic linking is active, all linkedwindows are immediately updated when any of the linked objects are alteredwith respect to crystal definition, orientation relationship, stage orientationor beam orientation. If, static linking is active, the window is updatedwhen it is brought to the forefront with respect to the accumulated changessince it was last updated. Selection of the linking method is most commonlydetermined by processor speed. All windows which are opened after the Linkingflag is set in the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Misc.%20Parameters%20Dialog.html">SetMisc. Parameters </A>dialog box are Linked. Those windows opened beforelinking was activated will remain static windows. Linking is found by goingto the <A HREF="../Menu%20Items/ParameterMenu.html">Set Misc. Parameters</A>:menu item found under the Parameter Menu. <H3>XVI. Data Reduction:</H3>With the advent of version 2.0, Desktop Microscopist takes serious stepstowards the ability to quicky and semi-automatically analyze the crystallographyof a unknown sample. Thus, desktop now supports the ability to determinea primitive lattice from a given experiment, the ability to plot orientationson a stereogram and the capability to relate plotted oreintations by meansof orientation relationships. <H4>A. Determine 2-d lattice from Experimental Pattern</H4>You can now generate a 2-d lattice from an experimental pattern using speciallydesigned tools. This 2-d lattice can then be tabulated to generate a completelist of d-spacings and angle between planes. <H4>B. Primitive Lattice From 2 Diffraction Patterns</H4>Using the stage control and the lattice generation tools, from two diffractionpatterns and known tilts from a standard double tilt holder, D.M. can nowcalculate a primitive lattice. <H4>C. Lattice Generation From Full Pattern Info</H4>Given an SAD pattern with HOLZ rings, it is now possible to calculate aprimitive lattice based on a single pattern. <H4>D.<A HREF="../How%20To/PoleDiagrams.html"> Pole Figures</A></H4>One of the more technologically important aspects of crystallography isunderstanding how physical forces determine crystal orientation and theeffect a biased orientation has on the mechanical and physical propertiesof the product material. Now, using the SAD pattern, a specially linkedStereogram, and the Zone Axis Tool, you can develop a detailed understandingof the texture of a material. <H3>E. Orientation Relationships From 2 Diffraction Patterns:</H3>Also using an SAD object, a specially linked Stereogram object, and theZone Axis Tool, it is possible to deterimine a set of orientations for twocrystals. It requires only a zone axis pattern from each crystal and a knowledgeof the tilt angles as recorded from a standard double tilt holder. Thus,it is now possible to easily explore orientation relationships between matrixand precipitate, between twins, between grains etc. <H3>XX. Image Processing:</H3>You can set a second order aspect ratio component and eliminate distortionsin your image. <BR><BR>The program now gives the user control over the bit transfer method forimage formation. This allows the user to control picture overlays on plottedpatterns. In addition, you may select the plotting sequence of images andsimulated patterns. <H3>XXI. Database Enhancements:</H3><H4>Search NBS/NIST and JCPDF Databases</H4>It is now possible to search the NBS/NIST Crystal Database, the JCPDF PowderDiffraction Database and the Electron Diffraction Database (EDD). The twoadditional databases (JCPDF and NBS) contain 200,000+ cyrstals. These crystaldatabases are distributed by the ICDD and are available either through VirtualLaboratories or the ICDD. <H4>Additional Search Logic</H4>Additional search logic operators have been included to support the NBSCrystal Data and JCPDF Powder Diffraction database indecies. <H3>XXV. Phase Diagrams:</H3>Phase Diagrams are now stored as individual files. <BR><BR>A Phase Diagram Editor has been included to allow users to add additionalPhase diagrams of interest. This program is ahareware and may be freelydistributed with the appropriate acknowledgements and information. See theincluded documentation for details. <H3>Data Output</H3><H4>A. Additional ASCII Options</H4>You can now output most data in the form of ascii text for incorporationinto other databases, word processing programs or spread sheets. <H4>B. New Graphic Objects</H4>Two objects have been added, a <A HREF="../Desktop%20Objects/Datapresentationdevices.html">graphobject</A> and a <A HREF="../Desktop%20Objects/Datapresentationdevices.html">tableobject</A> to encourage additional graphical representation. The graph objectscontain some methods for spectra mathematics, addition, subtraction, fouriertransform and a means to output the data into a tab delimited ascii file.The table object is a minispread sheet that allows export of any data, printingof data,formatting of text and some manipulation of the cells. <H3>XXVIII. General Improvements:</H3><H4>A.Speed and Reponse</H4>Major improvements in the speed and responsiveness of the program shouldbe noticed. This improvement is especially evident with the PowerPC familyof processors. Speed improvements of over 10x on some calculations. <H4>B. Flexible Labelling</H4>Labelling is more flexible, allowing multiple poles to be labelled witha single selection. <H4>C. Improved Functions</H4>Many other functions have been altered to improve utility. <H4>D. Smoothing of Image Updates/Increased Memory Needs</H4>The default method for plotting images is to use offscreen bitmaps. Thischange makes image changes smooth and updates instantaneous. The user shouldnotice significant improvement in the response of the program when bringingup Dialog Boxes, switching windows etc. With this change, the memory requirementshave become much greater for D.M. 2.0. The user needs to be aware of thisand make appropriate changes in the memory allocation for D.M. 2.0. <H4>E. Continuous Tilting</H4>Greater utilization of the <A HREF="../MathAndMisc/Keyboard%20Equivalents.html">keyboard</A>has allowed continuous tilting in all sections which use the singlecrystal methodology (Real Lattice, SAD, CBED, Back Reflection Laue, StereographicProjection, Kikuchi Maps etc.). <H4>F. Stereographic Projection Enhancements</H4>Functionality in the Streographic section includes the use of Rotationalsymmetry operators to add spots, the ability to plot poles for all directions,and the ability to rotate around any pole. <H4>F. <A HREF="../Desktop%20Objects/ControlDefaultParamters.html">PreferenceFile</A></H4>The development of a preference file will allow the user to retain Beamand Crystal settings between sessions, as well as Search Path selections,any changes to the x-ray and electron scattering data base, and alterationsto the crystal shape menus. <H4>G. New <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/SetAllParameters.html">Total DefinitionDialog Box</A></H4>With the addition of some relatively complex calculations which requiremultiple parameter definitions, it became increasingly difficult to definethe set-up using multiple dialog boxes. There is now a single dialog boxfor the definition of all required parameters for the particular window.This addition simplifies and organizes simulation set-ups for the new user.All the old dialog boxes have been retained and can be accessed on an individualbasis for single parameter changes. <BR><A HREF="datastructures.html">Data Structures</A><HR><I>Author:James T.Stanley <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">J.
