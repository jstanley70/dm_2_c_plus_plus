Compressed onto the hard drive.<B>Double click on the icon</B>. This will cause the following actions tooccur:   <LI>A folder called Desktop Microscopist Folder will be created.   <LI>Desktop Microscopist will be stored in this folder.   <LI>A folder called Desktop Microscopist Crystals will be created in theDesktop Microscopist Folder with a selection of crystals.   <LI>A set of Phase Diagram Files will be placed in the Desktop MicroscopistFolder. </UL><H3>Once the decompression is complete, delete the Compressed File</H3><UL>  <LI>After decompression, the Desktop Compressed file may be deleted fromthe Hard Drive. <B>Do not erase your master copy!!</B>Feel free to makeas many copies of Desktop Microscopist for backup purposes as desired. </UL><H3>Turn off the computer. Attach the hardware key</H3><UL>  <LI>After placing the D.M. Init file in the system folder, turn off thecomputer. Next, attach the hardware key. To do this, insert the hardwarekey into any active ADB port. The hardware key may be connected to the keyboard,between the key board and the Macintosh, between the mouse and the keyboardor any other active ADB port. The recommended placement of the hardwarekey is in-line with the keyboard, plugged into the back of the CPU. Oncethe hardware key has been inserted into an appropriate port, the computermay be re-started.<B>DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INSTALL THE KEY WHILE THE COMPUTERIS ON!</B> </UL><H3>Installation is now complete!</H3><UL>  <LI>Desktop Microscopist may be launched by double clicking on:   <UL>    <LI>The <A HREF="IconImages.html">Application Icon </A>(looks like anelectron microscope).     <LI>A <A HREF="IconImages.html">crystal file</A> (looks like a primitivecubic crystal with one atom per cell).     <LI>A <A HREF="IconImages.html">Diffract Object File</A> (looks likean electron microscope on a dog-eared piece of paper).   </UL></UL>Double Clicking on the application Icon will open the default definitionportion of the program (no Object Windows) and generate an inital preferencefile. Double clicking on a crystal file will open the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/CrystalDM.html">DefaultMatrix Crystal Definition Dialog box</A> and fill in the parameters withpreviouslhy stored information. Double Clicking on a Diffract Object Filewill bypass the Default Definitions and immediately open the correct windowtype and plot the stored graphic. <UL><A HREF="../Tutorial/Tutorial.html">To Go To The Tutorial</A><BR><HR></UL><I>Author:James T.
