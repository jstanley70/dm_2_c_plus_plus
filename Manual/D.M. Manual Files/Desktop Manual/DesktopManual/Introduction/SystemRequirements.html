System 6.0. or later is requiredto run Desktop Microscopist. <H3>Optimal Configuration:</H3>To obtain the maximum value from Desktop Microscopist a color monitor whichsupports 8-bit grey and 8-bit color, 14 MB of RAM, ;at least 10MB of harddrive and a Mac II running with system 7.1 or above is recommended. Alternatively,any PowerPC with the additional memory will give resonable response times.Virtual Labs distrubutes both FPU and PPC native applications. <BR><BR>Additionally, a Data Translation Quick Capture card or equivalent may beadded for support of image capture using cameras. Further functionalityis gained with the additional purchase of the Electron Diffraction Database;the NIST Crystal Database, or the JCPDF Powder Diffraction File availablefrom Virtual Laboratories or ICDD. In general, Desktop Microscopist is bothgraphic and computationally intensive and therefore improvements in processoror video speed will enhance performance. <H3>Technical Expertise; of the User:</H3>To make effective use of this manual and the program Desktop Microscopist,it is necessary to be familiar with use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)and the theory of diffraction and imaging concepts for high energy beams(x-ray, electron etc.).<BR><BR>This manual is not intended as a tutorial on diffraction theory. It willnot take an unskilled user from no knowledge of diffraction to a competentunderstanding of the subject. Appendices are included with the <A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/Math.html">pertinentmathematical equations</A> used to develop the program. However, these equationsare for reference purposes and not for pedagogical reasons. To gain morefamiliarity with either the graphical user interface or diffraction andimaging concepts, please refer to the Macintosh Manuals and Hypercard forGUI support and any of a number of textbooks on diffraction. <A HREF="../references.html">Somegood starting points</A> <H3>Future Directions-Help Wanted:</H3>As with version 1.0, Desktop Microscopist 2.0 is a significant step forwardtowards an integrated environment for crystallography. However, there isalways room for improvement. Specific planned improvements include increasedfunctionality in the Real Lattice section to allow the user more capabilitiesfor understanding the bonding and geometric relations between groups ofatoms, calculation of lattice energies and the effects of dislocation etc.BEKP patterns need to support experimental information with some variationon The Zone Axis Tool. Threading of various calculations to allow multi-taskingwhen long calculations are in use. Support for extraction of experimentalintensities from patterns and semi-automated optimization of parametersto the experimental condition could significantly enhance Desktop Microscopist.Full simulations of Diffractometer plots is expected in the next release,as well as, tools for the Laue diffraction object.<BR><BR>Most importantly, Virtual Labs is dependent on users for additional needsand suggestions.
