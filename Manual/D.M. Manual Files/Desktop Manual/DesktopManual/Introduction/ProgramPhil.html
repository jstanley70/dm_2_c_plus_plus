Program Philosophy:</CENTER></H2><BR>Virtual Laboratories is committed to the development, production and distributionof effective simulation programs for the sciences which facilitate the transferof information between the experimental and theoretical worlds. We believethat it is through the effective presentation of theoretical concepts appliedin an interactive simulation of real world environments that the world oftheory can find its greatest expression and utility. <BR>Desktop Microscopist has been written to supply a broad range of computationaland representational methods for the electron/x-ray microscopist and materialscientist with the highest degree of flexibility, ease of use and user/programinteractivity possible given current technology. We are dedicated to thecontinued development of Desktop Microscopist and to the development ofother related programs for the physical sciences. <H3>I.Descendent of Diffract</H3><BR>Although Desktop Microscopist is a direct descendant of Diffract ;v1.4 andother more vertically oriented programs, Desktop Microscopist differs fromthese previous programs in its utilization of the object oriented paradigmand in its greater integration of x-ray and electron diffraction theory.These two driving forces (object oriented programming and the integrationof diffraction theory) from different disciplines have been synergisticallyintegrated in the code development of Desktop Microscopist to create a flexible,easily expandable program which covers a large range of diffraction phenomena.<H3>II. Object Orientation</H3><BR>The field of software engineering is perhaps the most rapidly changing technologicalfield in the world today. This growth has been spurred by the acceleratingimprovement in computer hardware technology and the rapidly expanding userbase which is becoming both more demanding and also highly interconnected.With this rapid expansion in computer capability and support base, codehas become significantly more complex and difficult to manage, maintainand expand. It is through the use of object oriented techniques that weare seeking to circumvent these difficulties. <H3>III. Merging Of Theoretical Fields</H3><BR>The theoretical similarity between different diffraction phenomena has beenestablished since the early 1900's. It is possible to look at ionic, neutron,x-ray and electron diffraction as similar phenomena which adhere to thesame rules. However, the specific qualities of a neutron versus x-ray andan x-ray versus electron implies significant differences in experimentaltechnique and sensitivity to specific elements/material properties. Exampleswould be the use of vacuum and the need for lenses for electron diffractionversus x-ray diffraction, etc. The different high energy beam diffractiontechniques have led to different nomenclature and a separation of theoryand practice. The modern computer with its ability to store a vast amountof needed parameters and its rapid processing capabilities lends itselfto the reunification of these disparate fields. Desktop Microscopist isthe beginning of an effort to utilize the power of the personal computerto encourage this reunification. <H3>IV. The Desktop Environment</H3><BR>Desktop Microscopist takes advantage of object oriented concepts to createa multi-windowed environment with a large number of different but stronglyrelated objects. Each object supports a specific type of calculation restrictedby specific physical assumptions. These physical assumptions and/or limitscan continuously be refined in subsequently derived objects. It is expectedthat these benefits will allow Desktop Microscopist to expand into a numberof areas including image simulation and dynamical theory of CBED and HOLZpatterns. <H3><A HREF="NewWithTwo.html">V. Future Directions(See New With Version2.0)</A></H3>In addition to the strong support of pattern simulation, Desktop Microscopistis beginning to support the direct comparison of calculated with theoreticalresults. To this end, Desktop Microscopist allows the user to import ;and/orgrab in real time patterns which can be subsequently analyzed for pertinentdata. Desktop Microscopist has also begun to address the question of dataaccess and comparison (data base functionality). It is possible to searchfor and retrieve crystals from the Electron Diffraction Database, the JCPDFPowder Diffraction Files<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image47.gif" WIDTH="31"HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">, the NIST Crystal Database<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image47.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> and Desktop Microscopist crystal files. The Electron Diffraction Database,the Powder Diffraction Data base and the NIST Crystal Database are availableseparately; contact Virtual Laboratories for details. <BR><A HREF="ProgramCapabilites.html">Program Capabilities</A><BR><HR><I>Author:<A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">James T.Stanley <BR></A></I><IMG SRC="../../FrontPage/FrontPageImages/DesktopLogo.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ISMAP><A HREF="../Table%20Of%20Contents/DMManual.html">DesktopManual<BR></A><I><A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/~virtlabs/">Distributed By: VirtualLabs</A><BR>Last Updated:1/12/96 Sat, Apr 27, 1996 </I></BODY></HTML>
