After selecting this function, severalsub-functions are available:  <LI>Clicking on an unlabeled spot will add a label to it.  <LI>Clicking on a spot with a label will remove that label.  <LI>Clicking on a line and holding down the mouse button will attach alabel to that line. This label may be pulled to any location on the mapand will remain connected to the associated line.  <LI>Clicking on a line label and holding down the mouse button will allowthe label to be re-positioned.  <LI>Holding down the &lt;shift&gt; key and clicking on a line or zoneaxis will cause deeper objects at the same location to be labeled.  <LI>Clicking on a line label while holding the &lt;shift&gt; key willdelete the label.</UL><I>Note: Line labels are deleted whenever the object is rotated or zoomed.</I><H4>Kikuchi Map:Info Menu:Angles Between Spots:</H4>This function displays the angular distance between two spots. The firstspot is selected by &lt;shift&gt; clicking on a spot. Subsequent clicksprovide a second spot for the angular measurement, which is displayed onscreen. To change the first point, &lt;shift&gt; click on a different spot.It is also possible to &lt;shift&gt; click on lines and set a line as thereference point for angular measurements. Measurements between lines, spots,or lines and spots are possible.<H4>Kikuchi Map:Info Menu:Show Info:</H4>After selecting this item, clicking on a spot and holding down the mousebutton will display an information box about the selected spot. For lines,the information displayed includes: the Miller indices of the associatedplane, the crystal, d-spacing, Structure Factor, and Extinction distanceof the plane. For zone axes, only the Miller Indices and the crystal aregiven.<H4>Kikuchi Map:Info Menu:Text Table - Calculated...</H4>This item takes the stereographic poles and Kikuchi Lines and displays themin a text box as numerical data.<H3><CENTER>Kikuchi Map:Function Menu</CENTER></H3><H4>Kikuchi Map:Function Menu:Re-Define...;:</H4>Brings up the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Kikuchi%2FKosselDef.html">Kikuchi/KosselMap definition dialog box</A>. This allows the re-definition of the activeKikuchi/Kossel Map.<H4>Kikuchi Map:Function Menu:Re-Draw;:</H4>Redraws the current Kikuchi/Kossel Map in the form as originally specifiedor as last specified by the Re-Define function.<H4>Kikuchi Map:Function Menu:Add Line / Zone Axis...;:</H4>This item brings up the Add Spots dialog box. This is the same dialog boxas obtained under the Add a Spot function within the Stereographic Projectionssection. It should be noted that when planes are added to a Kikuchi/KosselMap new lines appear, whereas when directions are added new zone axes areadded to the map.<H4>Kikuchi Map:Function Menu:Delete Line / Zone Axis...;:</H4>After this item has been selected, clicking on spots or lines will removethem from the Kikuchi/Kossel Map.<H4>Kikuchi Map:Function Menu:Irrational Dir:</H4>This item displays the Miller indices of the zone axis and the plane normalthat would be displayed by a spot on the Kikuchi/Kossel Map located at thecurrent cursor position. Moving the cursor provides a continuous displayof the Miller indices of these zone axes.<H3><CENTER>Kikuchi Map:Rotation Menu;</CENTER></H3><H4>Kikuchi Map:Rotation Menu:Rotate To Center:</H4>After selecting this item, clicking on a zone axis will rotate the map suchthat the selected zone axis is at the center of the map.<H4>Kikuchi Map:Rotation Menu:Rotate To Vertical:</H4>After selecting this item, clicking on a zone axis will rotate the map aroundthe center such that the selected zone axis is directly above the centerof the map.<H4>Kikuchi Map:Rotation Menu:Rotate To Horizontal:</H4>After selecting this item, clicking on a zone axis will rotate the map aroundthe center such that the selected zone axis is directly to the right ofthe center of the map.<H4>Kikuchi Map:Rotation Menu:Rotate About Center:</H4>After selecting this item, &lt;shift&gt; clicking on a zone axis will seta reference point for a subsequent rotation of the map around the center.<H4>Kikuchi Map:Rotation Menu:Rotate About X - Axis:</H4>After selecting this item, &lt;shift&gt; clicking on a spot will set a referencepoint for a subsequent rotation of the projection around the X axis.<BR><H4>Kikuchi Map::Rotation Menu:Rotate About Y - Axis:</H4>After selecting this item, &lt;shift&gt; clicking on a spot will set a referencepoint for a subsequent rotation of the projection around the Y axis.<BR><H4>Kikuchi Map::Rotation Menu:Rotate About Any Pole:</H4>After selecting this item, &lt;shift&gt; clicking on a spot will set a referencepole for a subsequent rotation of the projection around this pole.<BR><H4>Kikuchi Map:Rotation Menu:[001] Standard Projection:</H4>Selecting this item causes the map to rotate to a standard [001] zone axisorientation.<H4>Zoom In;:</H4>Selecting this item allows the user to pull a box around a given portionof the map. The bounds of this box represent the bounds of the display afterthe zoom is complete. Releasing the mouse causes the zoom to take place.Clicking on a zone axis without zooming results in a 2x zoom around theselected spot.<BR><I>NOTE: Selecting Re-Draw from the Function menu will cause the KikuchiMap to be drawn at full size for the window.</I><H4>Kikuchi Map:Rotation Menu:Zoom Previous:</H4>1.Causes the previous zoom to be displayed.<BR><I>NOTE: Selecting Re-Draw form the Function menu has the same effect asZooming all the way out. Use Re-draw to return the projection to its standardmagnification.</I><H4>Kikuchi Map:Rotation Menu:Lock / Unlock Spots:</H4>When this function is invoked, spots may be locked and/or unlocked. Whena spot is locked it does not rotate with the projection. A locked spot isindicated by a horizontal x is drawn through its center. At the first rotation,the locked spot is cloned and a locked copy of the spot remains fixed onthe projection for the first and all subsequent rotations. The spot remainsfixed until such time as the spot is unlocked. When the spot is unlockedthe horizontal x marking will shift to a vertical x. Cloned spots are notsubject to re-cloning if they are re-locked. <BR><HR><I>Author:James T.
