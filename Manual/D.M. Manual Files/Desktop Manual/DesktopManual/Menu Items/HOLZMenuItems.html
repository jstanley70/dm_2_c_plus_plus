In this case, it is necessary to implementthem in a slightly different fashion to handle the difference between aline and a point. <H4>HOLZ Lines:Info Menu:Labels;:</H4><UL>  <LI>To add a label, click on the line of interest. Desktop Microscopistwill implement one of two methods of inserting a label.   <LI>The first method is used with straight line plots and the second methodwith curved plots.The first method uses a tangential definition of lineproximity to define the nearest line to a point. Once Desktop Microscopistfinds the closest line, it will display a box around the current cursorposition and draw a line from the corner of the box to the end of the highlightedHOLZ line. The box may be moved to an appropriate position. If the cursoris moved across the central bisector of the HOLZ line, the line drawn betweenthe label box and the end of the HOLZ line will snap to the opposite endof the HOLZ line. Typically, the text box will be placed outside the diameterof the definition HOLZ disk.   <LI>The second method uses calculated diameter comparisons to determinethe nearest curved line. However, once the second method has determinedthe closest line, it is very similar to the first method. The differencein this case is that the line drawn between the curved HOLZ line and thebox label forms a perpendicular to the tangent at the current point. Thispoint is then fixed once the label cursor is outside the definition HOLZdisk. Thereafter, the line is drawn between this point and the label boxirrespective of the box position relative to the HOLZ disk.Delete labelsby clicking on the same line again. Alternatively, a label may be deletedby holding the &lt;shift&gt; key down and clicking on the desired label.</UL><H4>HOLZ Lines:Info Menu:Angle Between Spots (Lines):</H4>The angle between spots is the same function as in the SAD or Stereographicprojection. The only difference is in the selection of lines instead ofspots. <H4>HOLZ Lines:Info Menu:Info:</H4>Provides the same functions as in SAD derived objects. Click on the lineof interest and a pop-up menu will appear to the upper left of the currentwindow. <H4>HOLZ Lines:Info Menu:Text Table - Calculated: </H4>Selecting this menu item brings up a text table object with a numericallist of the calculated diffraction lines. <H4>HOLZ Lines:Info Menu:Delete Spots (Lines):</H4>Functions as 'Delete Line'. Click on a line to delete it from the pattern.<H4>HOLZ Lines:Info Menu:Rotate Pattern:</H4>Used in a similar fashion to the SAD Object Rotate Pattern. Click on twopoints (the cursor must be moved after clicking to see the drawn line) torotate the pattern from the first point into the second point. Rotationsare around the center of the pattern, and the reference points are definedby the position of the mouse when the button is released. <H4>HOLZ Lines:Info Menu:Move Pattern;:</H4>This function is the standard move pattern function; it provides a methodfor altering the pattern's position within the window. <BR><I>Note: The moving disk is the same size as the HOLZ disk. This substantialsize increase is due to the definition of the central disk as the convergenceangle of the diffraction pattern.</I> <H3><CENTER>HOLZ Lines:Exp. Info:</CENTER></H3>The Experimental Info menu is significantly different from the SAD Objectexperimental info menu. The HOLZ experimental subroutines consist solelyof functions which allow rapid comparison of slight distortions in the unitcell. <H4>HOLZ Lines:Exp. Info:Crystal Distortion Menu:</H4><UL>  <LI>This menu item brings up a hierarchical menu which allows selectionof a parameter which will be varied incrementally. The program allows distortionof all lattice parameter variables as well as the accelerating voltage.Using the mouse, these variables may be distorted by motion in the horizontalplane. (Make sure the mouse button is down.) Movement in the vertical planedistorts the next variable to the right as listed in the ruler.   <LI>The arrow keys may be used to distort the crystal as well. The horizontalarrows provide the ability to increment the variable of interest. The verticalarrows provides a means of cycling through the lattice parameters and theaccelerating voltage.   <LI>Once the parameters have been adjusted as desired, the Reset Crystalitem from this menu must be selected to actually modify the crystal usedin this calculation. </UL><H4>HOLZ Lines:Exp. Info:Reset Crystal:</H4>Selecting this menu item will cause the original crystal parameters andaccelerating voltage to be replaced by the currently distorted crystal parametersand the current accelerating voltage. Desktop Microscopist automaticallyre-configures the crystal space group and crystal family and recalculatesthe image to reflect the changes in parameters.<BR><HR><I>Author:James T.
