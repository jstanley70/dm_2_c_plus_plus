The first two menus are variants of the standard File andEdit menus. The File menu is used to manipulate and print files. The Editmenu is used to cut and paste data, to view space group and atomic informationand provide access to Open Windows and to Set the . <BR><BR><I>(For Version 1.x users:) The Set Plot Parameters Function has been brokeninto 2 dialog boxes which can be found in the </I><A HREF="ParameterMenu.html"><I>ParametersMenu.</I>.</A> <H3><CENTER>File Menu:</CENTER></H3><H4>File Menu:New:</H4>Opens a new window for the object of interest. Desktop Microscopist supportsa number of objects. Each of these objects may be opened using the hierarchicalselection found under the New menu item. These choices also may be accessedby using &lt;cmd-N&gt;. <H4>File Menu:Open:</H4>The Open command &lt;cmd-O&gt; brings up a standard Macintosh File OpenDialog box. Access to all Desktop Microscopist Objects and Crystal DefinitionFiles which have been stored on an accessible permanent storage device (HardDrive etc) is accomplished with this item. <H4>File Menu:Import:</H4>The Import command brings up a standard Macintosh File Open Dialog box.This command is context sensitive. When selected with a plotting windowsuch as the SAD, or Dislocation Image object, it will allow importing ofPICT files. When selected with a graphing window, it will allow the importingof ASCII tab delimited spectra.<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image41.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> <H4>File Menu:Close:</H4>Use this option to Close the active window; &lt;cmd--W&gt; has the sameeffect. There is no automatic reminder to save the data before the closeis executed. This decision is based upon the infrequent need to save files.(Typically, only crystals and the Default parameters are stored as all otherobjects are derived from these.) <H4>File Menu:Save:</H4>This option will save any changes to the current file. It does not opena new file. The Save As... menu item must be used to define a new file.<H4>File Menu:Save As:</H4>Use this menu item to create a file which stores the data necessary to openand restore the active object to its current state. Holding the &lt;shift&gt;key when selecting this option will save the plotted image as a PICT file.This has some advantages when including an image in a report or document.By using the Apple PICT format the maximum resolution of the printing devicecan be accessed. <H4>File Menu:Export:</H4>Use this menu item to create a file which stores the data in ascii or pictformat. <H4>File Menu:Page Set-Up:</H4>This opens the Page Set-Up Dialog box which is used to control general printerparameters, such as orientation on the page, enlargement and options suchas font substitution. <H4>File Menu:Print:</H4>This brings up the print dialog box and supports the standard Macintoshprint procedure. <H4>Search Paths:</H4>This menu item brings up the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Serach%20Dialog%20Box.html">SearchPath's dialog box</A>. This dialog box allows the user to specify whereDesktop Microscopist stores and searches for files. Nine different searchpaths may be specified. The CODENs and EDD search paths are for accessingthe Electron Diffraction Database. The Desktop Crystals search path is usedto specify the default location for storage and retrieval of Desktop Microscopistcrystals. The Phase Diagrams path is used to specify the location of phasediagrams and the Desktop Docs path is used to specify the default locationof Desktop Microscopist object files. <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image42.gif"WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The NBS Indexlocation is for the NBS Crystal Database Indexes, the NBS File is the maincrystal information file for the NBS Database, the JCPDF Index, and JCPDFFile have similar functions.<H4>File Menu:Quit:</H4>Quits Desktop Microscopist. <I>THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE OPEN FILES IS NOTPROVIDED. </I><H3><CENTER>Edit Menu</CENTER></H3><H4>Edit Menu:Undo:</H4>This is included to support the Macintosh environment. It has no effectin Desktop Microscopist. <H4>Edit Menu:Cut:</H4>Cut will copy the selected region into a bit map. To select a region, clickthe mouse down and drag over the region of interest. There must not be acurrently active function and the mouse cannot click on a bit map region.The Cut command does not erase the picture on screen but simply stores itto the clipboard. The ability to select a region is the default functionof the mouse. The Cut command is not supported in the table object. <H4>Edit Menu:Copy;:</H4>Exact same functionality as the Cut command. <H4>Edit Menu:Paste:</H4>Use the Paste command to Paste the cut/copy bit map into the current window.This command does not work in the table object. <H4>Edit Menu:Clear:</H4>This option will delete the top bit map or all selected bit maps which aredisplayed in the current window. It has no effect on the calculated images.<H4>Edit Menu:Select All:</H4>This command will select all bit maps currently displayed on the screen.Use the Clear command to delete or the mouse to move selected objects. <H4>Edit Menu:Refresh:</H4>This command will cause a redraw of the current picture. Use it to cleanthe screen of any debris left from mouse functions. <H4>Edit Menu:Set Background Color...:</H4>Brings up the Color wheel to set the current window's background color.<H4>For Users of version 1.0 Edit Menu:<A HREF="ParameterMenu.html">SetPlot Parameters.</A>..;: Has Been Moved.<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image40.gif"WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Edit Menu:Space Group Tables...;:</H4>Opens the space group menu and allows the selection and viewing of any ofthe 230 space groups. <H4>Edit Menu:Atomic Parameters...:</H4>Use this menu item to view stored parameters for each element type. In additionthis menu item allows access to the Atomic Scattering Factors editor. Theoptions are described in the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Atomic%20Info%20Dialog.html">AtomInformation Dialog Box. </A><H4>Edit Menu:Windows..:</H4>This menu item contains a hierarchical menu list of currently open DesktopWindows. It aids the user when trying to find a particular window. <H4>Edit Menu:Set Picture Transfer Modes..:<IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image43.gif"WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H4>Picture Transfer Modes can be critical when working with imported pictures.The ability to see an overlayed pattern and the calculated pattern is dependenton the Background Color, the Image pixel intensities and the colors selectedfor the calculated picture. It is impossible to find one transfer mode settingfor all possible situations. Therefore, with version 2.0, there are 4 suppliedsettings and a fifth option which allows the user to play around with thetransfer modes to find an optimal set. The four modes are <UL>  <LI>Default Set-Up. This setting should work for most situations. It willadd colors when spots overlay in calculated patterns.   <LI>White Background. This setting should work for most situations wherethe Background color is set to white.   <LI>Black Background. This setting should work for most situations wherethe Background color is set to black.   <LI>Forced Overlay. This setting forces Desktop Microscopist to work inPict mode. The advantage of this setting is that it will force the calculatedpattern to appear over any picture with any background color. The main disadvantageis slow replotting and response time. In addition, the user will lose theability to visually see situations where diffraction intensities from differentcrystals overlay, i.e. the last plotted spot is the plotted color. </UL><BR>The fifth mode is User Defined. This is included for completness and worksby allowing the user to move through the different Transfer Mode possibilitiesfor the calculated and the experimental patterns to determine an optimalsetting. There is an extensive help line displayed when selected.<BR>Use the left and right arrows to change calculated pattern transfer modes.Use the up and down arrows to change the experimental transfer mode. Useopt-t to change the plotting order.(whether the experimental pattern orthe calculated pattern is plotted first). <BR><HR><I>Author:James T.
