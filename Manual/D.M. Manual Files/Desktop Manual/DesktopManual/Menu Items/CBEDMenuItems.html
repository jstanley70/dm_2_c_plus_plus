Simply clickon the point of interest and the plot will be generated.  The spot is takenas the dead center of the CBED disk selected by the user.<H4><I>CBED</I>:<I>Bloch Calculations</I>:Thru Tilt: </H4>This item will generate a Plot of Intensity as a function of position inthe CBED Disk.  Currently, the calculation is generated by drawing a linefrom the Beam Direction to the center  of the selected CBED disk.  Thencalculating intensities along this line from the point on the CBED diskfurthest from the origin to the point closest to the origin.  See Figure:<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image328.gif" WIDTH="183" HEIGHT="264"ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>  For the Central Disk, intensities are deteremined vertically and thenhorizontally, in alternate calculations.<BR><BR>NOTE:<BR><H4><I>CBED</I>:<I>Bloch Calculations</I>:Critical Voltage:</H4>At a particular orientation, intensity will very with variation in the acceleratingvoltage of the microscopie.

This goal can be accopmlished by indicating to Desktopthat it should treat the particular spot using perturbation theory.  Selectthis item and then click on any spots which you which to be treated as perturbations.<H4><BR><I>CBED</I>:<I>Bloch Calculations</I>:Increase Plot Res.: </H4>Increases the number of points (by 30%) calculated when deteriming an x-ygraph of intensity versus a particular parameter.<H4><BR><BR><I>CBED</I>:<I>Bloch Calculations</I>:Decrease Plot Res: </H4>Decreases the number of points (by 30%) calculated when deteriming an x-ygraph of intensity versus a particular parameter.<BR><HR><I>Author:James T.
