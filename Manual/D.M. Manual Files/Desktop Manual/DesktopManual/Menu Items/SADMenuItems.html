This Dialog Box allows the specificationof orientation, crystals to be plotted and streaking parameters. <H4>SAD:Define Menu:Calculate Zone Axis: </H4>Recalculates and Plots down the current primary zone axis. (This functionis used to return to down zone from an irrational zone axis.) <H4>SAD:Define Menu:Double Diffraction Iterative: </H4>Double diffraction (Dynamic Diffraction) can be simulated in a relativelystraight forward manner. In a standard first approximation, double diffractionis simulated by geometric addition of the precipitate g-vectors with thematrix g-vectors. <BR><BR><I>Note: The above description is essentially the technique used withinthis program. However, instead of restricting diffraction between matrixand precipitate g-vectors, all g-vectors are allowed to interact and a specificcriteria is used for the determination of whether or not a given spot willbe visible. Intensity is determined by multiplication of intensities andcomparison to a minimum threshold. When calculating double diffraction spots,Desktop Microscopist compares the current spot intensity and the new intensityand replaces it with the larger of the two. However, Desktop Microscopistdoes not override primary diffraction intensities.</I> <H4>SAD:Define Menu:Delete Double Diffraction: </H4>Use this menu item to delete all current diffraction spots which were generatedby the double diffraction subroutine. <H4>SAD:Define Menu:Delete Weak Spots: </H4>Often times when calculating diffraction patterns for complex crystal families,there will be numerous diffraction spots which are not visible. When lookingat the effects of double diffraction, it is important to eliminate thesespots because Desktop Microscopist does not override primary diffractionintensities when calculating double diffraction. <H4>SAD:Define Menu:Increase Intensity:</H4>This option allows the user to increase the current log dynamic range constantby .5 without accessing the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamDefinitionDialogBox.html">BeamDefinition Dialog Box</A>. Use this option to flatten out and improve diffractionspot visibility. <H4>SAD:Define Menu:Decrease Intensity:</H4>This option allows the user to decrease the current log dynamic range constantby .5 without being required to access the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/BeamDefinitionDialogBox.html">BeamDefinition Dialog Box</A>. Use this option to enhance contrast and decreasediffraction spot visibility. <H3><CENTER>Info Menu:</CENTER></H3><H4>SAD:Info Menu:Labels:</H4>Selecting this menu item turns the arrow pointer to the gun sight cursor.Clicking on a spot will automatically label the spot. Clicking on the spotagain will erase the label. If the &lt;shift&gt; key is held down, DesktopMicroscopist will allow the successive labeling of a single diffractionspot with overlapping labels from each of the corresponding crystals. <H4>SAD:Info Menu:Angle between spots:</H4><UL>  <LI>Use this menu item to determine the angle between diffraction spots.The angle calculated for this spot is the actual distance in the three dimensionallattice. When dealing with angles between spots from different order Lauezones, the angle calculated may not be the same as the angle of the projecteddiffraction pattern. To determine this angle, Use the Get Angle + Zone Axisoptions under the Exp. Info Menu.   <LI>To calculate an angle between spots, a reference spot must first beset. Setting of the reference spot is accomplished by holding the &lt;shift&gt;key down while clicking on the first spot. Subsequent clicks with the mousewill allow the user to determine angular information between the referencespot and each subsequently selected point of diffraction intensity. To changethe reference spot, simply hold the &lt;shift&gt; key down when clickingon the new point. </UL><H4>SAD:Info Menu:Info: </H4>Selecting this menu item turns the arrow pointer to the gun sight cursor.Clicking on a spot will automatically bring up pertinent information aboutthat spot. If the &lt;shift&gt; key is held down, Desktop Microscopist willsuccessively provide information regarding other diffraction spots whichoccupy the same point in reciprocal space, but are generated by a differentcrystal or from a different Laue Zone. <H4>SAD:Info Menu:Text Table - Calculated: <IMG SRC="../ManualImages/image39.gif"WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H4>Selecting this menu item brings up a text table object with a numericallist of the calculated diffraction spots. <H4>SAD:Info Menu:Add Spots by Sum:</H4>Desktop Microscopist provides the user with a number of different methodsfor the addition and moving of points of interest. To use the Add Spot bySum option, a base diffraction spot must be specified by clicking and holdingthe mouse down. Immediately, a line denoting a g-vector of the same lengthand direction as the original g-vector is generated. However, this vectorstarts from the original spot. By moving the mouse over another spot, thetwo vectors are added and the end of the line shows where the new spot willappear. Releasing the mouse will set the new diffraction point at this location.This method ensures that the new diffraction spots are exact summationsof two current diffracting points. Double clicking on any spot will bringup the Spot Info dialog Box which allows the user to set spot parameters.<H4>SAD:Info Menu:Add Spots:</H4>Selecting this menu item activates the add spot function. Any mouse clickwill add a spot at the screen location. The default parameters for any addedspot are hkl (001) and the matrix crystal. Double clicking on this spot(or any spot) will bring up the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Add%20Spot%20CBED.html">SpotInfo dialog Box </A>which allows the user to set spot parameters. <H4>SAD:Info Menu:Move/Re-configure:</H4>After selecting this menu item individual spots may be moved and re-configured.To move a spot, click on the spot of interest and move the mouse. To re-configurea spot, double click on the spot and the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Add%20Spot%20CBED.html">SpotInfo dialog Box</A> will appear. The Spot Info dialog box allows the userto set the parameters for the selected spot. <H4>SAD:Info Menu:Delete Spots:</H4><UL>  <LI>After selection of the Delete spot menu item, clicking on a spot willcause that spot to be deleted.   <LI>Desktop Microscopist provides the user with two methods for manipulatingwhole patterns. The first is the Rotate Pattern function which allows theuser to rotate the diffraction pattern with respect to the transmissionbeam. The second method allows the user to move the diffraction patternin the x-y plane. Both of these features have been added to assist withthe comparison of the calculated images to experimental diffraction patterns.</UL><H4>SAD:Info Menu:Rotate Pattern:</H4>To rotate the pattern, Select the Rotate Pattern option from the Info menu.Click and drag the mouse to the spot which is to be rotated. This actionwill draw a reference line from the transmitted beam to the tip of the mousecursor. Next, release the mouse and click on the spot to which it is desiredto have the previously drawn line rotate into. Let go of the mouse. Thepattern will be rotated into the desired orientation.<BR>In all subsequent diffraction patterns, this rotation about the centralzone axis direction is maintained. Given the normal low angle of rotations,this is an excellent approximation to a typical experiment. <H4>SAD:Info Menu:Move Pattern:</H4>After selecting this menu item, click on the central transmission spot and,while holding down the mouse button, move the pattern to the desired location.Releasing the mouse button will cause the pattern to be moved such thatthe center of the pattern will be located at the position where the mousebutton was released. <H3><CENTER>Experimental Menu:</CENTER></H3><H3><I>SAD:Experimental Menu<BR>Laue:Experimental Menu</I></H3><H4>SAD:Experimental Menu:Set Reference Crystal:</H4>Desktop Microscopist supports a number of methods for extracting informationfrom an experimental diffraction pattern. Two such methods are the comparisonexperimental d-space information and angle between plane information toa stored crystal. Matches to the comparison crystal are displayed as rulerinformation. Due to the complexity of the comparison, Desktop Microscopistwill access only a single crystal at a time. To set the crystal which willbe compared with experimentally derived information, use the Set ReferenceCrystal menu item. Use the subsequently displayed hierarchical menu to selectthe desired crystal.<BR><I>Note: Use the matching option with care. Desktop Microscopist storesa set selection of plane values (&lt;30) which may or may not contain asufficient number of points to be accurate. In addition, the limited displayspace means that all potential matches may not be displayed.<BR></I><BR>The rest of the Experimental Menu is a collection of hierarchical menuseach hierarchical menu is designed to collect related techniques together.<UL>  <LI>Line/Ring Methods:   <LI>Volume Methods:   <LI>Lattice Methods.   <LI>Correct Image. </UL><H4>SAD:Experimental Menu:Line/Ring Methods:Get d-spacings + Plane (RingM.);:</H4>Use this item to obtain d-space and g-vector information from a stored diffractionpattern. After selecting this option, clicking on the screen will causethe appearance of a ring which expands and contracts around a point correspondingto the center of the calculated diffraction pattern. The corresponding d-spaceand any planes which match the experimental value are displayed in the informationsection of the ruler. Pressing &lt;option - m&gt; brings up the magnificationdialog box with the distance corresponding to the diameter of the last ring.Holding the &lt;opt-a&gt; (add) keys down and clicking will insert the d-spacecorresponding to the diameter of the last ring into a list of experimentald-spaces. Holding the &lt;opts-s&gt; (subtract) keys down will clear allstored experimental d-spacings. This list will be accessed and displayedwhen opening the Search Dialog Box. <H4>SAD:Experimental Menu:Line/Ring Methods Menu:Get Angle + Zone Axis (RingM.):</H4>Use this item to get d-space information from two planes and the angle betweenthese two planes. It will also provide any experimental zone axes whichmight potentially match the zone axis. <H4>SAD:Experimental Menu:Line/Ring Methods Menu:Get d-space + Plane (LineM.):</H4>Use this to get d-space and g-vector information from the separation oftwo parallel lines (like K-lines). Its functionality is the same as theGet d-space + Pane (Ring M.) To determine the d-space, two parallel linesmust first be drawn. Do this as in any standard drawing program. After thelines are drawn, the parallel lines may be moved, stretched and rotatedusing the cursor. Clicking on the middle of a line will move both end points.Clicking on an end point allows movement of that end but not the other.Pressing &lt;option - m&gt; brings up the magnification dialog box withthe distance corresponding to the length of the first line (not the distancebetween the lines). <H4>SAD:Experimental Menu:Line/Ring Methods Menu:Get Angle + Zone Axis (LineM.):</H4>Use this menu item to get the d-space values and the angle between two setsof two parallel lines. Again, these lines most typically can be used inconjunction with Kikuchi lines. The first two lines are taken as parallel,and the second two lines are taken as parallel.<BR><I>Note: For both line methods, the distance between the two lines is takenas the average distance between end points. </I><H4>SAD:Experimental Menu:Volume Methods Menu:Calc. Primitive Cell Volume:</H4>This function will allow the calculation of a primitive cell volume froman experimental pattern containing a zero order zone and at least one higherorder Laue zone ring. Using a photographic negative of an experimental patternwhich contains a higher order spots, import the image using CCD camera ora scanner. Move the image into an SAD or CBED by using the cut and pasteoption or opening a PICT file directly. Finally, center the calculated diffractionpattern over the transmission beam of the imported image. (This may be doneby either moving the negative or by moving the calculated pattern). Selectthe Calc. Primitive Cell Volume option. At this point, the imported imagewill be magnified by a factor of 2x and the function will be Get Angle +Zone Axis (Ring M.) . Select two g-vectors, keep them prime (1 g-vectornot 2 g-vectors etc.) After selecting the two g-vectors, holding the &lt;shift&gt;key down click on the mouse. The negative will be returned to its originalmagnification and Desktop Microscopist will be in the Get D-spacings + Plane(Ring M.) function. Pull the ring until it is centered on the first orderLaue zone. Read the reduced cell volume in the information line of the ruler.<H4>SAD:Experimental Menu:Volume Methods Menu:Numerical Primitive Cell Calc...:</H4>This menu item activates the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/PrimitiveCellVol.html">PrimitiveCell Volume Numerical Calculation Dialog Box</A>. It mimics the functionalityof the previous item. In this case, the experimental information is enteredin a digital form. <H3><CENTER>SAD:Experimental Menu:Lattice Methods:</CENTER></H3><B>SAD:Experimental Menu:Lattice Methods:Generate Lattice:<BR>SAD:Experimental Menu:Lattice Methods:Add Spots Manually:<BR>SAD:Experimental Menu:Lattice Methods:Center Spots:<BR>SAD:Experimental Menu:Lattice Methods:Tabulate Experimental Spots:<BR>SAD:Experimental Menu:Lattice Methods:Delete Lattice Points:<BR></B><H3><CENTER>SAD:Experimental Menu:Correct Image:</CENTER></H3><B>SAD:Experimental Menu:Correct Image:Set Magnification-Lines<BR>SAD:Experimental Menu:Correct Image:Set Magnification-Ring Method<BR>SAD:Experimental Menu:Correct Image:Set Aspect Ratio<BR>SAD:Experimental Menu:Correct Image:Correct Image<BR>SAD:Experimental Menu:Correct Image:Delete Aspect Points</B><H3><CENTER>Search Menu:</CENTER></H3><H4><I>SAD:Search Menu:<BR>Laue:Search Menu:<BR>HOLZ Lines:Search Menu:</I></H4>The Search menu is found in all objects which have been derived from theSAD object. Use it to search the EDD, the Powder Diffraction File, the NISTCrystal Data File and Desktop Microscopist crystals for matches to currentexperimental values. <H4>SAD:Search Menu:Search Chemistry;:</H4>1. Selection of this item brings up the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/PeriodicTableDialog.html">periodictable</A> used to set potential chemistries. <H4>SAD:Search Menu:Search by d-space;: </H4>Selection of this item brings up the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Serach%20Dialog%20Boxes.html">searchdialog box</A> with the display list set for d-space values. <H4>SAD:Search Menu:Search by g-vector;:</H4>Selection of this item brings up the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Serach%20Dialog%20Boxes.html">searchdialog box</A> with the display list set for g-vector values. <H4>SAD:Search Menu:Search by volume;:</H4>Selection of this item brings up the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Serach%20Dialog%20Boxes.html">searchdialog box</A> with the display list set for d-space values and set up forsearch by crystal volume. <H4>Other Information:</H4>When leaving the search dialog box, if crystals have been found and selected,a list of the found crystals will be added to the Search Menu. Selectinga crystal from this list will cause the crystal to display an appropriatepattern (ring pattern for projection, bar graph for diffractometer) correspondingto calculated d-space values. Holding the &lt;shift&gt; key down when selectingthe crystal will activate the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/CrystalDefDialog.html">crystaldefinition dialog box</A>. Insert this crystal into the desired window ordefault crystal by clicking on the Dump button in the dialog box and selectingthe correct option.<BR><BR><HR><I>Author:James T.
