In addition to the standardmenus, the Stereographic Projection object has three others, <B>Function</B>,<B>Info</B> and <B>Rotation</B>: <H2><CENTER>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu</CENTER></H2><H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:Re-Define...:</H4>Brings up the<A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/StereoDef.html"> Stereographic Projectiondefinition dialog box</A>. This allows the re-definition of the currentlydisplayed stereographic projection. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:Re-Draw;:</H4>Redraws the current projection such that it will fit within the bounds ofthe Stereographic Projection window. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:Add a Spot...:</H4>Brings up the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Add%20Spots%20Stereo.html">AddSpots Dialog box</A>. This box provides the ability to add individual planesor directions or alternatively all planes or directions of a given type.<H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:Delete a Spot:</H4>Poles on the stereogram may be deleted by clicking on them. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:Plane Traces;:</H4>This is a toggling function. Click on a spot to add a plane trace. The tracedisplayed will be the trace of the plane whose normal is equivalent to thatof the selected spot. Clicking on a pole that already has a displayed planetrace associated with it will cause that trace to be hidden. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:Plane Trace Through Points:</H4>The poles shown on a stereographic projection are representations of a setof vectors which intersect one another at the center of the projection sphere.Therefore, the selection of two points is equivalent to the selection ofa unique pair of intersecting vectors. Any pair of intersecting vectorsmay be said to define a plane. The Plane Trace Through Points function promptsfor the selection of two points and then displays the trace of the planedefined as a result. The pole of the resultant plane is added to the stereogram.<H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:Small Circles:</H4><UL>  <LI>A small circle represents the trace of a cone whose central vectoris defined by a pole on the stereogram, and its intersection with the stereographicprojection sphere. Within Desktop Microscopist, small circles are definedby a pole and the half angle of the apex of the cone (the angle betweenthe central vector and the side of the cone).   <LI>The Small Circles function is a toggling function. Clicking on a spotthat has a small circle already associated with it will delete that smallcircle. Clicking on a spot defines that spot as the central vector for thecone. Hold the mouse down and drag to define the half angle of the cone.The half angle will be displayed within the ruler as the circle is beingpulled. Release the mouse at the proper angle. </UL><H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:Add Tensile Axis...:</H4>This item brings up the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Add%20Tensile%20Axis.html">AddTensile Axis dialog box</A>. The parameters lambda an u correspond to anglesas measured on a Wulff net along the horizontal and vertical axes respectively.The result of this function is the definition of a direction pole with aspecified angular orientation with respect to the central pole of the stereographicprojection. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:Irrational Dir:</H4>This item displays the Miller indices of the direction pole and the planenormal that would be displayed by a spot on the projection located at thecurrent cursor position. Moving the cursor provides a continuous displayof the Miller indices of this vector. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:Add a Defect Trace...:</H4>This menu item brings up the <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Add%20Defect%20Trace.html">AddA Defect Trace dialog box</A>. For a micrograph of a defect, <B>g</B> andthe beam direction are entered. When the dialog is closed, <B>g</B> willbe rotated to vertical and the angle of the defect trace with respect to<B>g</B> is then entered. This action will result in a plane trace beingadded to the stereogram, this plane contains the set of possible directionvectors for the defect in question. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:<A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Find%20Defect%20Direction.html">Finda Defect Direction...</A>:</H4>This is identical to Add A Defect Trace above except that two traces areadded. It is assumed that two micrographs of the same defect are being entered.Since each plane has within it the direction vector of the defect, the intersectionof the planes represents the true direction of that defect. The programwill automatically add a pole at the intersection of the two planes. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:Select a Habit Plane...:</H4>This item first prompts for a direction. The direction is rotated to thecenter and a dialog box is displayed. <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/StereoHabitPlane.html">Thedialog box </A>provides the mechanism to search for planes whose normalfalls within a user specified angular deviation from 90&#176;. The planeswithin this range are displayed. These planes are displayed and may be broughtto the center of the stereogram and &quot;selected&quot; or marked on thestereogram. These planes represent the set of probable habit planes forthe direction in question. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Function Menu:Add Spots by Symmetry...:</H4>This bring up a <A HREF="../Dialog%20Boxes/Add%20Spots%20By%20Symmetry.html">dialogbox</A> which allows poles to be added based on symmetry operations. <H2><CENTER>Stereographic Projection:Info Menu</CENTER></H2><H4>Stereographic Projection:Info Menu:Labels:</H4>This is a toggling function. After selecting this function, clicking onan unlabeled spot will add a label to it, clicking on a spot with a labelwill remove that label. Holding the &lt;Shift&gt; key down allows labelingand display of the set of planes located at the same position in projectionspace. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Info Menu:Angles Between Spots:</H4>This function displays the angular distance between two spots. The firstspot is selected by &lt;shift&gt; clicking on a spot. Subsequent clicksprovide a second spot for the angular measurement, which is displayed onscreen. To change the first point, &lt;shift&gt; click on a different spot.<H4>Stereographic Projection:Info Menu:Show Info:</H4>After selecting this item, clicking on a spot and holding down the mousebutton will display an information box about the selected spot. For planes,the information displayed includes: the Miller indices of the spot, thecrystal, d-spacing, Structure Factor, and Extinction distance of the plane.For directions only the Miller Indices and the crystal are given. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Info Menu:Text Table - Calculated...</H4>This item takes the stereographic poles and displays them in a text boxas numerical data. <H2><CENTER>Stereographic Projection:Rotation Menu;</CENTER></H2><H4>Stereographic Projection:Rotation Menu:Rotate To Center:</H4>After selecting this item, clicking on a spot will rotate the projectionsuch that the selected spot is at the center of the projection. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Rotation Menu:Rotate To Vertical:</H4>After selecting this item, clicking on a spot will rotate the projectionaround the center such that the selected spot is directly above the centerof the projection. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Rotation Menu:Rotate To Horizontal:</H4>After selecting this item, clicking on a spot will rotate the projectionaround the center such that the selected spot is directly to the right ofthe center of the projection. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Rotation Menu:Rotate About Center:</H4>After selecting this item, &lt;shift&gt; clicking on a spot will set a referencepoint for a subsequent rotation of the projection around the center. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Rotation Menu:Rotate About X - Axis:</H4>After selecting this item, &lt;shift&gt; clicking on a spot will set a referencepoint for a subsequent rotation of the projection around the X axis. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Rotation Menu:Rotate About Y - Axis:</H4>After selecting this item, &lt;shift&gt; clicking on a spot will set a referencepoint for a subsequent rotation of the projection around the Y axis. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Rotation Menu:Rotate About Any Pole:</H4>After selecting this item, &lt;shift&gt; clicking on a spot will set a referencepole for a subsequent rotation of the projection around this pole. <H4>Stereographic Projection:Rotation Menu:[001] Standard Projection:</H4>Selecting this item causes the projection to rotate to a standard [001]projection. <H4>Zoom In:</H4>Selecting this item allows the user to pull a box around a given portionof the projection. The bounds of this box represent the bounds of the displayafter the zoom is complete. Releasing the mouse causes the zoom to takeplace. Clicking on a spot without zooming results in a 2x zoom around theselected spot.<BR><I>NOTE: Selecting .Re-Draw; from the Function menu will cause the Stereographicprojection to be drawn at full size for the window.</I> <H4>Stereographic Projection:Rotation Menu:Zoom Previous:</H4>Causes the previous zoom to be displayed.<BR><I>NOTE: Selecting Re-Draw from the Function menu has the same effect asZooming all the way out. Use Re-draw to return the projection to its normalmagnification.</I> <H4>Stereographic Projection:Rotation Menu:Lock / Unlock Spots:</H4>When this function is invoked, spots may be locked and/or unlocked. Whena spot is locked, it does not rotate with the projection. A locked spotis indicated by a horizontal x drawn through its center. At the first rotation,the locked spot is cloned and a locked copy of the spot remains fixed onthe projection for the first and all subsequent rotations. The spot remainsfixed until such time as the spot is unlocked. When the spot is unlockedthe horizontal x marking will shift to a vertical x. Cloned spots are notsubject to re-cloning if they are re-locked. <BR><BR><HR><I>Author:James T.
