This brings up the Lattice Definition/Set-up Dialog Box. Use it to setthe crystal to be displayed, the size of the lattice to be calculated, thedefault radius type (covalent, metallic, etc.) and the initial scale ofthe plot.<BR>405. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Lattice Menu:Re-Draw;:<BR>1. Redraws the current plot.<BR>406. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Lattice Menu:Hide Atom;:<BR>1. Clicking on an atom after selection of this menu item will hide thisatom and allow the user to view any atoms behind the hidden atom.<BR>407. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Lattice Menu:Hide Element;:<BR>1. Clicking on an atom will hide all atoms of the same element type. Forexample, in a copper oxide crystal, clicking on an oxygen atom will hideall but the copper atoms.<BR>408. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Lattice Menu:Slice Lattice;...:<BR>1. This menu item activates the Slice Lattice Dialog Box. Use this dialogbox to view single planes or groups of atoms. It works by hiding all atomswhich do not meet a geometric selection criteria.<BR>409. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Lattice Menu:Show All;:<BR>1. This restores the lattice to its original state, with no atoms hidden.<BR>410. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Lattice Menu:Zoom In;:<BR>1. This doubles the scaling parameter of the current plot and causes anautomatic re-plot of the lattice.<BR>411. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Lattice Menu:Zoom Out;:<BR>1. This cuts in half the scaling parameter of the current plot and causesan automatic re-plot of the lattice.<BR>412. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Lattice Menu:Zoom All;:<BR>1. This option automatically refits the lattice to fit inside the viewingregion of the current window.<BR>413. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Lattice Menu:Render Plot;:<BR>1. Use this menu item to toggle between a flat display (rapid re-plot butlittle 3-d cueing) and a rendered three dimensional display (slow re-plotbut better 3-d cueing) of the calculated lattice.<BR>414. .c3.IV.M.2 Info Menu;:.i.Real Lattice:Menus;<BR>415. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Info Menu:Label Atom;:<BR>1. Labels the selected atom with the element symbol. Element symbols includethe ionic state of the atom. <BR>416. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Info Menu:Atomic Info;:<BR>1. Brings up a pop-up display of information on the selected atom.<BR>417. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Info Menu:Distance Bet. Atoms;:<BR>1. Gives the distance between two atoms. The first atom selected is consideredthe reference atom. Any subsequent click gives the distance between thereference atom and the selected atom. To change the reference atom, holdthe &lt;shift&gt; key and click. This action resets the function to itsoriginal state.<BR>418. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Info Menu:Angle Bet. Atoms;:<BR>1. Gives the angle between three atoms. The first two atoms selected areconsidered reference atoms. The second atom selected is the origin or pivotatom. Any subsequent click gives the angle between the vector from the firstatom to the second reference atom and the vector between the second referenceatom and the selected atom. To change the reference atoms, hold the &lt;shift&gt;key and click. This action resets the function to its original state.<BR>419. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Info Menu:Direction of 2 Atoms;:<BR>1. Gives the direction of the vector connecting two atoms. The first atomselected is considered the reference atom. Any subsequent click gives thevector direction between the reference atom and the selected atom. To changethe reference atom, hold the &lt;shift&gt; key and click. This action resetsthe function to its original state.<BR>420. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Info Menu:Plane info 3 Atoms;:<BR>1. Gives the plane which contains the three selected atoms. The first twoatoms selected are considered reference atoms. The second atom selectedis the origin or pivot atom. Any subsequent click gives the plane betweenthe vector from the first atom to the second reference atom and the vectorbetween the second reference atom and the selected atom. To change the referenceatoms, hold the &lt;shift&gt; key and click. This action resets the functionto its original state.<BR>421. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Info Menu:Highlight Atom Plane;...:<BR>1. This menu item activates the Highlight Atom Plane Dialog Box which allowsthe user to highlight specific planes in a plotted lattice. <H3>Real Lattice:Menus:Info Menu:Highlight Closest Neighbors;:</H3>1. Clicking on an atom will locate its nearest neighbors, count them anddetermine their average distance from the selected atom. Holding down the&lt;shift&gt; key will highlight the next nearest neighbor atoms.<H3>Rotation Menu;:.i.Real Lattice:Menus:Rotation Menu;</H3>1. The first three menu items will rotate the lattice by degrees aroundthe three principle axes. <BR>424. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Rotation Menu:Rotate about x;:<BR>1. The x axis is horizontal and parallel to the monitor screen. To workthis rotation, click and move the mouse. Releasing the mouse will causethe lattice to rotate by the prescribed degree.<BR>425. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Rotation Menu:Rotate about y;:<BR>1. The y axis is vertical and parallel to the monitor screen. To work thisrotation, click and move the mouse. Releasing the mouse will cause the latticeto rotate by the prescribed degree.<BR>426. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Rotation Menu:Rotate about z;:<BR>1. The z axis is perpendicular to the monitor screen. To work this rotation,click and move the mouse. Releasing the mouse will cause the lattice torotate by the prescribed degree.<BR>427. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Rotation Menu:Free Rotate;:<BR>1. This menu item will allow the user to rotate the crystal in an un-prescribedmanner. After selection, clicking on the screen will cause a plot of thecrystal morphology, as defined in the Crystal Shape Definition Dialog Box,to appear in the upper left corner of the active window. Moving the mousewill cause this crystal shape to rotate in real time. The current planeparallel to the screen and direction perpendicular to the screen is typedin the information portion of the ruler. Releasing the mouse will causethe lattice to rotate to the indicated orientation.<BR>428. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Rotation Menu:(001) Normal;:<BR>1. Returns the lattice to its original orientation with the &lt;001&gt;direction out of the screen.<BR>429. .i.Real Lattice:Menus:Rotation Menu:View by Dir. or Plane;...:<BR>1. This brings up the Rotate to Direction/Plane Dialog Box which allowsthe selection of a specific plane or direction for orientation of the lattice.The direction will be perpendicular to the screen monitor. The plane willbe parallel to the screen monitor.<BR><HR><I>Author:James T.
